# Four Fundamental Subspaces of a Matrix

## Column Space

- The column space of a matrix $A$ is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$. The column space of $A$ is denoted by $C(A)$. The column space of $A$ is the same as the range of $A$. The column space of $A$ is the same as the span of the columns of $A$.
- $Ax = b$ is consistent if and only if $b$ is in the column space of $A$.
- Suppose $A$ is a matrix with $4$ columns. Then $C(A)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$.
- Does every vector in $\mathbb{R}^4$ belong to $C(A)$? No. The column space of $A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$, but it is not all of $\mathbb{R}^4$.
