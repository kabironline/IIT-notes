# Directed Acyclic Graphs

- $G = (V,E), a directed graph with directed cycles$

### Topological Sort

- - $G$ has a topological sort if and only if $G$ has no directed cycles
  - Enumerate all vertices in $G$ such that if $(u,v) \in E$ then $u$ appears before $v$ in the enumeration
  - Feasible if $G$ has no directed cycles

### Longest Path

- $\text{longest-path-to}(i)=1+\text{max\{longest-path-to(j)|}(j,i \in E)\}$
- To compute $\text{longest-path-to}(i)$, we need to know $\text{longest-path-to}(j)$ for each incoming edge $(j,i)$
- If graph is topologically sorted, we can compute $\text{longest-path-to}(i)$ in $O(V+E)$ time

#### Alogrithm

- Compute **in-degree** of each vertex
  - Scan each column of the adjacency matrix
- Initialize $\text{longest-path-to}(i)=0$ for all $i \in V$
- List a vertex $i$ with $in-degree(i)=0$ in the queue then remove it from the queue
- Update $\text{longest-path-to}(i)$ for each vertex $i$ adjacent to $j$ and remove $j$ from the queue
- Repeat until the queue is empty
