# End-Behaviour of Polynomials

- As we have already observed, the behaviour of polynomial function
  - $f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n+1}...+a_1x+a_0$
- The behaviour of the polynomial function is either increasing or decreasing as the value of $x$ increases which makes is mainly due to the fact that the leading terms dominate the behaviour of the function. This behaviour is called the end-behaviour of the polynomial function.
- As observed in quadratic eqations, if the leading term of a polynomial fucntion, $a_nx^n$m is an even power the function and $a_n > 0$, then $x$ increases or decreses, $f(x)$ is unbounded.
- When the leading term is an odd power function, as $x$ decreases or increases, $f(x)$ is bounded, as x increases or and is unbounded.
