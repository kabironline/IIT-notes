# Parallel and Perpendicular lines

Can we guess the line from the slope?

- We cannot guess the line from the slope because there may be more than one line with the same slope.
- If two lines have the same slope, they are **parallel**.

## Characteristics of parallel lines via slope.

- Suppose we have two lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ which are non vertical and parallel, and have slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively, which is $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively.
- If $l_1$ and $l_2$ are parallel, then $\alpha$ = $\beta$.
- It is clear that tan($\alpha$) = tan($\beta$).
- Hence $m_1$ = $m_2$.

## Characteristics of perpendicular lines via slope.

- Suppose we have two lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ which are non vertical and perpendicular, and have slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively, which is $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively.
- $l_1$ and $l_2$ are perpendicular, then $\alpha$ = $\beta$ + $90°$.
- Now tan($\alpha$) = $\tan(\beta + 90°)$. = $-\cot(\alpha)$. = $\frac{1}{tan(\alpha)}$.
- Hence $m_1$ = $- \frac{1}{m_2}$ or $m_1m_2$ = $-1$.

## Relation of angles between two lines and their slopes.

- Let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be two lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ with inlcination $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ respectively.
- Suppose $l_1$ and $l_2$ intersect and let $\phi$ and $\theta$ be the angles between $l_1$ and $l_2$.
- Now $\theta$ = $\alpha_2$ - $\alpha_1$. for $\alpha_1$ $\neq$ $90$.
- $\tan(\theta)$ = $\tan(\alpha_2-\alpha_1)$= $\frac{\tan\alpha_1-\tan\alpha_2}{1+\tan\alpha_1\tan\alpha_2}$= $\frac{m_2 - m_1}{1 + m_1m_2}$.
