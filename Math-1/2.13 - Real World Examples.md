# Sum Squared Error
- The Squared Sum of the distances of points from the line of best fit is:
- $SSE = \sum(y_i-mx_i-c)^2$
  -
- $SSE$ is the summation from i to n of the squared difference between the actual value and the predicted value.
## Least Squares Motivation
- The least squares method is a method of finding the best fit line for a set of data.
- The line may not pass through any of the points, but it will be the line that minimizes the sum of the squared distances between the points and the line.
- In the case of a line, the equation of the line is $y = mx + c$.
## Examples
- [ ] If a line $y = x + 1$ is given for the data set $(0,1),(1,3),(2,4),(3,2),(4,5),(5,0),(6,8)$, what is the sum of the squared errors?
  - $SSE = (1 - 0 - 1)^2 + (3-1-1)^2 + (4-2-1)^2 + (2-3-1)^2 + (5-4-1)^2 + (0-5-1)^2 + (8-6-1)^2 = 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 36 + 1 = 48$/
