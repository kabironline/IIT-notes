# Distance of a given point from the given line
- [ ] To find the distance of a point $P(x_1,y_1)$ from the line $Ax+By+C=0$.
- For a given $A,B \ne 0$, Using the slope-intercept form.
- x-intercept = $-\frac{C}{A}$ and y-intercept = $-\frac{C}{B}$
- The shortest distance between a point $P$ and a line $Ax+By+C=0$ is its perpendicular distance from the line to Point $M$ on the line.
- $A(\triangle PRQ) = \frac{1}{2} \times QR \times PM$
- $PM$ is the height of the triangle $\triangle PRQ$ and the perpendicular distance from the line to the point $M$.
- $PM = \frac{2 \times A(\triangle PQR)}{QR}$
  -
- Using the Pythagorean theorem, $QR^2 = PM^2 + PR^2$
- And with the 3 points $P,Q,R$  we can find the area of the triangle $\triangle PQR$.
- The formula for the area of triangle $\triangle PQR$ is:
  - $\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{|C|}{|AB|}\times|Ax_1+By_1+C|$
    -
- Length of the base of the triangle $\triangle PQR$ is $QR$.
  - $QR  = \frac{|C|}{|AB|} \times \sqrt{A^2+B^2}$
    -
- Putting the formula for the area of the triangle $\triangle PQR$ and the length of the base of the triangle $\triangle PQR$ in the formula for the height of the triangle $\triangle PQR$ we get:
  - $PM = \frac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$

# Distance between two Parallel lines
- [ ] To find the distance between two parallel lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ with slopes $m$
- The x-intercepts of line $l_1$ from the general formula is $-\frac{c_1}{m}$
- The x-intercepts of line $l_2$ from the general formula is $-\frac{c_2}{m}$
- Comparing with the general formula we get $A=-m$ and $B=1$ and $C=c_2$
- By using the formula for the distance of a point from a line we get:
  - $d = \frac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$
    -
- The distance between the two parallel lines is the distance between the two points $P(x_1,c_1)$ and $Q(x_1,c_2)$
- Consdering the  point $P(\frac{-c_1}{m},0)$ we get
  - $d = \frac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}} = \frac{{|c_1- c_2|}}{\sqrt{1+m^2}}$
    -
- Using the general form, $m = \frac{A}{B}, c_1=\frac{C_1}{B},c_2 = \frac{-C_2}{B}$ then we get
  - $d = \frac{|c_1- c_2|}{\sqrt{1+m^2}} = \frac{|C_1-C_2|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$

# Examples
- [ ] Find the distance of the point $P(3,-5)$ from the line $3x-4y-26=0$
  - $A=3,B=-4,C=-26$
  - $d = \frac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}} = \frac{|3(3)+(-4)(-5)+(-26)|}{\sqrt{3^2+(-4)^2}} = \frac{3}{5}$
    -
- [ ] Find the distance between parallel lines $3x-4y+7=0$ and $2x-4y+5=0$
- $A=-3,B=4,C_1=7,C_2=5$
  - $d = \frac{|c_1- c_2|}{\sqrt{1+m^2}} = \frac{|7-5|}{\sqrt{1+(-3)^2}} = \frac{2}{5}$
