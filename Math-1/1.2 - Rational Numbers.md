- Rational numbers are the set of numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.
- Cannot represent 19/5
- Fractions are a special case of rational numbers.
- Rational numbers are denoted by $\mathbb{Q}$.
  - Numerator is the top number in a fraction.
  - Denominator is the bottom number in a fraction.
  - Denominator cannot be 0.
- We can add, subtract, multiply and divide rational numbers.
- We can also compare rational numbers using the usual comparison operators.
- **In order to compare rational numbers, we need to find a common denominator.**
- 3/5 + 4/5 = 7/5
- 3/5 + 4/6 = 18/30 + 16/30 = 34/30(least common denominator is 30)

## Redcued Fractions

- Reduced Fractions are fractions that have no common factors.
- 3/6 = 1/2

### Greatest Common Divisor

- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) is the largest number that divides two numbers.
- Example 1: GCD(18, 60) = 6
- Prime Factors of 18 = **2 x 3 x 3**
- Prime Factors of 60 = **2 x 2 x 3** x 5

## Density

### Integers

- Each integer has a density of 1.
- There is a number before and after each integer.
- m = 1, n = 1
- m + n = 2
- m - n = 0

### Rational Numbers

- This is not possible because there are an infinite number of rational numbers between any two rational numbers.
- There are an infinite number of rational numbers between 0 and 1.
- To find a rational number we can take the average of two rational numbers.
