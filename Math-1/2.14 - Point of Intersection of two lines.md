# Point of intersection of 2 lines:
- [ ] Find the point of intersection of the lines in their general form.
- We can find the point of intersection using ***substitution***.
- [ ] Find the point of intersection of the lines $2x+3y-12=0$ and $5x-10y+5=0$
  - $2x+3y-12=0$
  - $2x = -3y + 12$
  - $x = \frac{12-3y}{2}$
  - Substituting $x$ in the second equation
  - $5(\frac{12-3y}{2})-10y+5=0$
  - $\frac{60-15y}{2}-10y+5=0$
  - $30-\frac{15y}{2}-10y+5=0$
  - $30-\frac{35y}{2}+5=0$
  - $35-\frac{35y}{2}=0$
  - $35y = 70$
  - $y = \frac{70}{35} = 2$
  - Solving for $x$
  - $x = \frac{12-3(2)}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$
  - Therefor the point of intersection is $(3,2)$
- We can also find the point of intersection using ***Elimination***.
- [ ] Find the point of intersection of the lines $2x+3y-12=0$ and $5x-10y+5=0$
  - Multiply the first equation by 5
  - $5(2x+3y-12)=0$ $=$ $10x+15y-60=0$
  - Multiply the second equation by 2
  - $2(5x-10y+5)=0$ $=$ $10x-20y+10=0$
  - Subtract the two equations
  - $10x+15y-60=0$ $-$ $10x-20y+10=0$ $=$ $0x+35y-70=0$
  - $y = \frac{70}{35} = 2$
  - Solving for $x$
  - $2x+3(2)-12=0$
  - $2x+6-12=0$
  - $2x=6$
  - $x = \frac{6}{2} = 3$
  - Therefor the point of intersection is $(3,2)$
