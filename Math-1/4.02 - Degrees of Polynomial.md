# Degree of the Polynomial

- The exponent of the variable in a term is called the degree of that variable in that term.
- The degree of that term is the sum of the degrees of that variables in that term.
- The degree of the polynomial is the largest degree of the degree of the any one of the terms with non-zero coefficients.
- The degree of a constant is 0.

## Examples

- The degree of the polynomial $x^2 + 2x + 1$ is $2$.
- The degree of the polynomial $x^2 + 2x^2y^2 + 1$ is $4$.
- The degree of the polynomial $\sqrt{x^2 + 2x^2y^2 + 1}$ is $2$.
