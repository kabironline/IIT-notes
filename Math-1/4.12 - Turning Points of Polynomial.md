# Turning Points of Polynomial

- A Quadratic equation with a degree of 2 has 1 turning point.
- A turning point is a point of the graph where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing.
- We can hypothesise that a polynomial with a degree of $n$ has $n-1$ turning points.
## Examples
- Find the turning points of the polynomial function $f(x)=1+x^2=4x^5$.
  - The function will turn at most 4 times.
- Find the turning points of the polynomial function $f(x)=(x-1)^3(x+2)$.
  - The function will turn at most 3 times.
