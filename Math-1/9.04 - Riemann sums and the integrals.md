# Reimann sums and the integrals

- To find the area under the curve the most basic method is to divide the curve into rectangles and add them up.
- Using this we can get some approximation of the area under the curve.
- This can be made more accurate by increasing the number of rectangles and decreasing the width of the rectangles.

### Reimann sums

- The area under the curve is approximated by the sum of the areas of the rectangles.
- Suppose $f(x)$ is a function and $D \text{ to } \mathbb{R}$ for some domain $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.
- Let $P$ consist of the following data:
  - a partition of $[a,b]$ or the choice of intermidiate points $a=x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_n=b$
  - a choice of $x_i^* \in [x_{i-1,x_i}]$ and $||P|| =$ max $\{ \Delta x_i\}$
  - The Riemann sum is defined as:
    $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x_i$$
- But this method is not very accurate and crude.
- The better way is to use an Integral.

## Integral

- Let $f(x)$ be a function and $D \text{ to } \mathbb{R}$ for some domain $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Suppose the interval $[a,b]$ is in the Domain $D$.
- The **(definate) integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$** is defined as the limit of the Riemann sums as the number of rectangles goes to infinity.
  $$\int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x_i$$

### Examples

- $f(x)= 2x-1$
  - Find the area from [1,2]
  - $P_n = \{1,1 + \frac{1}{n},1 + \frac{2}{n}\}$
  - $x_i = 1 + \frac{i}{n}$
  - $1 = x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_n = 2$
  - $\Delta x_i = \frac{1}{n}$
  - $x_i^* = 1 + \frac{i}{n}$
  - $S(P_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) \Delta x$
    - $\sum_{i=1}^n (2\cdot (1+ \frac{i}{n})-1) \cdot \Delta x_i$
    - $\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (2\frac{i}{n^2})$
    - So computing the area under the curve using the Reimann sum:
    - $1 + \frac{2}{n^2} \sum^n_{i=1}i$
    - $1 + \frac{2}{n^2} \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
    - $1 + \frac{n+1}{n}= 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{n} = 2 + \frac{1}{n}$
    - $\lim_{||P_n|| \rarr 0} S(P_n) = \lim_{n \rarr \infty} 2 + \frac{1}{n} = 2$
