# Slope of a line
- The slope of a line is the ratio of the change in the y-coordinate to the change in the x-coordinate.
- It is also called the gradient of the line or rise over run.
- It is denoted by $m$.
- It is calculated by the formula:
- tan($\theta$) = $\frac{rise}{run}$
---
- If the line is horizontal, the slope is 0.
- If the line is vertical, the slope is undefined.
- The $\theta$ is the inclination of the line.
- if $\theta$ $\neq$ 90Â°, then $m$ = tan($\theta$)
- If the angle is an obtuse angle, then $m$ is negative.
- If the angle is an acute angle, then $m$ is positive.
