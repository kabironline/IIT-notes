# Representation of a Line

- [ ] How to represent a line uniquely?

- [ ] Given a point, how can we check if it lies on a line?

---

- For a given line $l$, we can represent it as $l: y = mx + c$. it describes the line $l$ on the coordinate plane.
- If the coordinate of the given point $P$, satisfies the expression for the line $l$, then the point $P$ lies on the line $l$.

---

- We can determine that a point $P$ lies on a line $l$ by substituting the coordinates of $P$ in the expression for the line $l$.
- We can use the following expression to determine if a point $P$ lies on a line $l$.
- $P(x,y)$ and $l=(x_0,y_0)$
- $(y-y_0) = m(x-x_0)$ or $m=\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}$
- This is called the **point-slope form** of the equation of a line.

### Example

- Find the equation of the line through a point $P(5,6)$ with slope $m=-2$.
  - Let $Q(x,y)$ be a point on the line $l$.
  - $\therefore$ we get this equation for the line $l$.
  - $-2 = \frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}$
  - $-2 = \frac{y-6}{x-5}$
  - $(y-6) = 2(5-x)$
  - $y = 10 + 2x + 6$
  - $y = 16 + 2x$

# Slope intercept form

## Y intercept

- Let the line $l$ with slope $m$ and it cuts the Y-axis at $c$. Then $c$ is called the **y-intercept** of the line $l$.
- That is , the point $(0,c)$ lies on the line $l$.
- Therefore, the equation of the line $l$ is $y = mx + c$.
- $y = mx + c$
  -

## X intercept

- Let the line $l$ with slope $m$ and it cuts the X-axis at $d$. Then $d$ is called the **x-intercept** of the line $l$.
- That is , the point $(d,0)$ lies on the line $l$.
- Therefore, by the Point-slope form of the equation of a line, we get the equation of the line $l$ as $y - y = m(x - x)$.

## Examples

- Find the equation of the line with the slope 1/2 and y-intercept -3/2.
  - $y = mx + c$
  - $y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}$
- Find the equation of the line with the slope 1/2 and x-intercept 4.
  - $y = m(x - d)$
  - $y = \frac{1}{2}(x - 4)$
  - $y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{4}{2}$
  - $y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2$

# Two Point Form

Suppose a line makes x-intercept at $a$ and y-intercept at $b$. Then the two points $(a,0)$ and $(0,b)$ lie on the line.

- Using the two point form,
- $(y-0) = \frac{b-0}{0-a}(x-a)$ or $\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1$
  -
## Examples
- Find the equation of the line with the x-intercept -3 and y-intercept 3.
  - $1 = \frac{x}{-3} + \frac{y}{3}$
  - multiply both sides by 3
  - $1*3 = \frac{3x}{-3} + \frac{3y}{3}$
  - $3 = -x + y$
  - $3 + x = y$ or $y = 3 + x$
