# Limits and Continuity

## Basic Rulues regarding continuity of

- if $\lim_{x \to a} f(a) = F$ then $\lim_{x \to a} g(a) = G$, then $\lim_{x \to a} (f+g)(x)= F+G$
- if $\lim_{x \to a} f(a) = F$ then $\lim_{x \to a} g(a) = G$, then $\lim_{x \to a} (f-g)(x)= F-G$
- if $\lim_{x \to a} f(a) = F$ then $\lim_{x \to a} g(a) = G$, then $\lim_{x \to a} (fg)(x)= FG$
- if $\lim_{x \to a} f(a) = F$ then $\lim_{x \to a} g(a) = G \neq 0$, then $\lim_{x \to a} (\frac{f}{g})(x)= \frac{F}{G}$
- If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)=F$ and c is a constant and belongs to $\mathbb{R}$, then $\lim_{x \to a} cf(x)=cF$
- The sandwich pricinple: If $f(x)$ is continuous at $a$ and $g(x)$ is continuous at $a$ and $g(x) \leq h(x) \leq f(x)$, then $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x)$

## Examples

- $f(x) = 5x^3 + 0.45x^2-2x+100$
  - $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 5\lim_{x \to a}x^3 + 0.45\lim_{x \to a}x^2-2\lim_{x \to a}x+\lim_{x \to a}100$
  - $f(a)= 5a^3 + 0.45a^2-2a+100$

## Continuity of functions

- A function $f(x)$ is continuous at it is continuous at $a$ if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$
- Algebriaclly, $f(x)$ if for a sequenece of real numbers $\{a_n\}$ then the $\lim f(a_n)$ and $f(a_n)$ converges to the same value
- We can think of continuity of a function as being able to draw the graph of a function without lifting our pencils.
- It means that there are no "gaps" in the graph of the function. The graph of a continuous function is a smooth curve.
- The floor function is not a continuous function because it has a "gap" in its graph.
- Some functions line $e^x, log(x), sin(x)$ are continuous everywhere, but not at every point.
