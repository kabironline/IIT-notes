# Distance Formula

- The distance between two points is the length of the line segment connecting them.
- We can use the pythagorean theorem to find the distance between two points.
- formula for distance between two points: $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
- For Example
  - if we have the points (3, 4) and Origin (0, 0) then the distance between them is $\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$
  - if we have the points (5, 6) and (-1, 2) then the distance between them is $\sqrt{(5 - (-1))^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{36 + 16} = \sqrt{52} = 7.21$
  - If the points (-1,1) and (1,3) then the distance between them is $\sqrt{(-1 - 1)^2 + (1 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 4} = \sqrt{4} = 2$
  - Find the values of aa for which the triangle ∆ABC is an isosceles triangle, where A,B, and C have the coordinates (−1, 1), (1, 3) and (3,a) respectively.
  - If AB = BC then $\sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (3 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8} = 2.83$
    - BC = 2.83
    - $\sqrt{8}$ = $\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (a - 1)^2}$
    - $\sqrt{8}$ = $\sqrt{4 + (a - 1)^2}$
    - $\sqrt{8}$ = $\sqrt{4 + a^2 - 2a + 1}$
    - $\sqrt{8}$ = $\sqrt{a^2 - 2a + 5}$
    - Square both sides
    - $8$ = $a^2 - 2a + 5$
    - $8 + 2a - 5$ = $a^2$
    - $a^2 + 2a - 3$ = $0$
