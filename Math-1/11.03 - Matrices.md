# Matricies

- A matrix is a two dimensional table
  - $r \times c$ matrix - $r$ rows and $c$ columns
  - Assume rows are numbered $\{0,1, \dots r-1\}$, columns are numbered $\{0,1, \dots c-1\}$
  - Graph with $n$ nodes, $n \times n$ adjacency matrix, entries are 0 or 1.

## Matrix Arithmetic

- For Matrix $M, M[i,j]$ is the entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column
- Let $A$ and $B$ be two different matricies.

### Matrix Addition

- $A+B$ is defined if and only if $A$ and $B$ have the same dimensions
- For each entry $A[i,j] + B[i,j]$
  $$C[i,j] = A[i,j] + B[i,j]$$

### Matrix Multiplication

- $A \times B$ is defined if and only if $A$ has the same number of columns as $B$ has rows
- For each entry $A[i,j] \times B[j,k]$
  $$C[i,k] = \sum_{j=0}^{c-1} A[i,j] \times B[j,k]$$
- The dimensions of $C$ are $r \times c$
  - If $A$ is $r \times s$ and $B$ is $s \times c$, then $C$ is $r \times c$

#### Example

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$
$B = \begin{bmatrix} 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 \\ 11 & 12 \end{bmatrix}$
$C = A \times B = \begin{bmatrix} 58 & 64 \\ 139 & 154 \end{bmatrix}$

# Boolean Algebra

- Booleans have 2 values: true and false, denoted by $1$ and $0$ respectively

## Boolean Or $(\lor)$

- $A \lor B$ is true if either $A$ or $B$ is true
- $A \lor B$ is false if both $A$ and $B$ are false
  - $0+0=0$
  - $0+1=1$
  - $1+0=1$
  - $1+1=1$

## Boolean And $(\land)$

- $A \land B$ is true if both $A$ and $B$ are true
- $A \land B$ is false if either $A$ or $B$ is false
  - $0 \times 0 = 0$
  - $0 \times 1 = 0$
  - $1 \times 0 = 0$
  - $1 \times 1 = 1$
