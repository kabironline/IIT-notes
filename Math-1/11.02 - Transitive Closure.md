# Transitive Clousre

- Let $R \subseteq S \times S$ be a relation on a set $S$.
- For instance , $S is a set of people, and $(p,q) \in R$ if $p$ is a parent of $q$.
- Can compute the ancestor relation from the parent relation.
- $p$ is an ancestor of $q$ if we can find a sequence of people $p_0, p_1, \dots, p_n$ such that $p_0 = p$, $p_n = q$, and $(p_i, p_{i+1}) \in R$ for all $i$.
  - $p = r_0$
  - For each $i \in \{0,1,2, \dots, n-1\}$, $(r_i, r_{i+1}) \in R$.
  - $q = r_n$
- This is called the **transitive closure** of $R$. It is denoted by $R^+$

## Computing the Transitive Closure

- Represent $R \subseteq S \times S$ as a directed graph $G = (V,E)$
  - $V=S$
  - $(u,v) \in E$ if $(u,v) \in R$
- $(u,v) \in R^+$ if and only if there is a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$
- We can compute the reachability in graphs using:
  - Breadth-first search
  - Depth-first search
- Perform BFS/DFS on $G$ to compute the transitive closure of $R$
  - $R^+$ is the set of edges in the BFS/DFS tree

---

- We can compute a adjecency matrix $A$ for $G$
- $A[i,j] =1$ if and only if there is a path from $i$ to $j$ in $G$
- Want $A^+[i,j] = 1$ if and only if there is a path from $i$ to $j$ in $G^+$

- $A^+ = A + A^2 + \dots + A^{n-1}$
  - $A^+[i,j] = 1$ if $i$ and $j$ connected by
    - Path of length $1$ or
    - Path of length $2$ or
    - $\dotsb \text{or}$
    - Path of length $n-1$

---

- $A^2 = A \cdot A$
  - $A^2[i,j] = 1$ if there is a path of length 2 from $i$ to $j$
  - $A^{l+1} = A^l \times A$
  - $A^{l+1}[i,j] = 1$ if there is a path of length $l+1$ from $i$ to $j$
- $A^+ = A + A^2 + \dots + A^{n-1}$

### Alternative Approach

- $B^k[i,j] = 1$ if there is a path from $i$ to $j$ via vertices $\{1,2, \dots, k-1\}$
  - Contstrint applies only to intermediate vertices in the path
  - $B^0[i,j] = 1$ if there is a direct edge from $i$ to $j$
  - $B^0 = A$
- $B^{k+1}[i,j] = 1$ if
  - $B^k[i,j] = 1$ can already reach from $i$ via $\{1,2,\dots,k-1\}$

## Warshall's Algorithm

- The algorithm computes the transitive closure of a relation $R$ represented as a directed graph $G$
- $B^k[i,j] = 1$ if there is a path from $i$ to $j$ via vertices $\{1,2, \dots, k-1\}$
  - $B^0[i,j] = 1$ if there is a direct edge from $i$ to $j$
  - $B^0 = A$
    - Direct Edges with no intermediate vertices
- $B^{k+1}[i,j] = 1$ if
  - B^k[i,j] = 1 or
  - B^k[i,k] = 1 and B^k[k,j] = 1

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

- Works with negative weights, but not negative cycles
- Let $SP^k[i,j] be the length of the shortest parth from $i$ to $j$ via vertices $\{1,2, \dots, k-1\}$
- $SP^0[i,j] = W[i,j]$
  - No Intermediate Vertices, Shortest path is weight of direct edge
  - Assume $W[i,j] = \infty$ if $(i,j) \notin E$
