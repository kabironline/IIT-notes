# Anti-Derivatives (indefinate Integrals)

- An anti-derivative of a function $f(x)$ is a function $F(x)$ such that $F'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in D$.
- Example: $f(x) = x^7 + 2x^6 - \pi x^5 + 0.5 x^4 -9$ has an anti-derivative $F(x) = \frac{1}{8}x^8 + \frac{1}{7}x^7 - \frac{\pi}{6}x^6 + \frac{1}{5}x^5 -9x + C$ where $C$ is a constant.
- **Fact**: If $F$ is an anti-derivative of $f$, then so is $F_1(x)=F(x)+C$ for any constant $C$. In Fact, every anti-derivative of $f$ is of the form $F(x) + C$ for some constant $C$.
## Anti-Derivative and integrals
- The anti-derivataive forr a fucntion $f$ is more often called the (indefinate) integral of $f$ and is denoted by
$$ \int f(x) dx$$
- The Riemann sum for the integral is
  - $\int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x_i$
  - Also known as the definite integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$.
## The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- Suppose $f$ is continuous on the domain $D$ which includes teh interval $[a,b]$.. Then an anti-derivative of $f$ is unique and is given by
$$F(x) = \int^x_a f(t) dt$$
