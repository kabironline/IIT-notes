# Derivatives

- The derivative of a function is the rate of change of the function with respect to the independent variable.
- A function is differentiable at a point if the derivative exists at that point.
- If a point is differentiable then it is also continuous at that point.

## Rules for Differentiation

- if $f(x)$ is differentiable at $a$ then $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$
- If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable at $a$ then $(f+g)(x)$ and $(f+g)'= f'(a) + g'(a)$
- If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable at $a$ then $(f-g)(x)$ and $(f+g)'= f'(a) - g'(a)$
- If $f(x)$ is differentiable at point $a$ and c is a constant and belongs to $\mathbb{R}$, then $cf(x)$ and $c(f)'= cf'(a)$

### Product Rule

- If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable at $a$ then $(fg)(x)$ then

$$(fg)'(a)= f'(a)g(x) + f(x)g'(a)$$

### Quotient Rule

- If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable at $a$ and $g(x) \neq 0$ then $(\frac{f}{g})(x)$

$$(\frac{f}{g})'(a)= \frac{f'(a)g(x) - f(x)g'(a)}{g(x)^2}$$

### Chain Rule

- If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable at $a$ then $(g \circ f)(x)$ and $(g \circ f)'(a)= g'(f(x))f'(a)$

## Examples

- $f(x) = x^n; n \in \mathbb{R}$

  - $f(x) = x^2$
    - Applying the product rule:
    - $f(x) = x^2 = x \cdot x$
    - $f'(x) = (x)' \cdot x + x \cdot (x)'$
    - $f'(x) = 1 \cdot x + x \cdot 1$
    - $f'(x) = 2x$
  - $f(x) = x^3$
    - Applying the product rule:
    - $f(x) = x^3 = x \cdot x \cdot x$
    - $f'(x) = (x)' \cdot x \cdot x + x \cdot (x)' \cdot x + x \cdot x \cdot (x)'$
    - $f'(x) = 1 \cdot x \cdot x + x \cdot 1 \cdot x + x \cdot x \cdot 1$
    - $f'(x) = 3x^2$
  - Therefore the general rule for $f(x) = x^n$ is $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$

- $f(x) = 5x^3 -17x^2 + \pi \cdot x -0.5$

  - $f'(x) = 15x^2 - 34x + \pi$

- $f(x) = x^7\sin(x)$

  - $f'(x) = 7x^6\sin(x) + x^7\cos(x)$

- $f(x) = \tan(x)$

  - $f'(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$
  - $f'(x) = \frac{\cos(x)\cdot\cos{(x)+\sin(x)\cdot-\sin(x)}}{(\cos(x))^2}$
  - $f'(x) = \frac{\cos(x)^2+\sin(x)^2}{cos(x)^2}$
  - $f'(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)^2} = \sec^2(x)$

- $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^r}$

  - $f'(x) = -\frac{rx^{r-1}}{x^{2r}}$

- $f(x) = \tan(2x)$
  - $f'(x) = \frac{\sin(2x)}{\cos(2x)}=\frac{2\tan(x)}{1-\tan^2(x)}$
  - $f'(x) = \frac{2}{1-\tan^2(x)}$
  - $f'(x) = 2\sec^2(x)$

## L'Hopital's Rule

- If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable at $a$ and $g(x) \neq 0$ then
- if $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$ then
  $$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$

- $f(x) = \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}$
  - $\frac{d}{dx} \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \ln(1+x) = \frac{1}{1+x} = 1$
  - Therefore the limit of the original function is 1

## Derivative of a Function

- The derivative of a function is the rate of change of the function with respect to the independent variable.
- It is given by this formula:
  $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$
- The derivative of a function is the slope of the tangent line at a point on the graph of the function.
- The tangent line of a differentiable function at a point is the line that passes through the point and is parallel to the tangent line at that point.
- It is given by this formula:
  $$y = f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$$
  $$\text{or}$$
  $$y = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}(x-a)+f(a)$$

## Linear Approximation

- The linear approximation of a function at a point is the line that passes through the point and is parallel to the tangent line at that point.
- If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $a$ then the linear approximation of $f(x)$ at $a$ is given by this formula:
  $$L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$$

- Conversely, if $L(x)$ is a linear function that passes through the point $(a, f(a))$ then $L(x)$ is the linear approximation of $f(x)$ at $a$ and $f'(a) = \frac{L(x) - f(a)}{x-a}$

### Examples

- $f(x) = x^3$ at $a = 1$
  - $f'(x) = 3x^2$
  - $L = f(1) + f'(1)(x-1) = 1 + 3(x-1)$
  - $L = 3x - 2$
- $f(x) = sec(x)$ at $a = 0$
  - $f'(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(x)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}} = 1$
  - $L = f(0) + f'(0)(x-0) = 1 + \frac{1}{\cos(0)}(x-0)$
  - $L = x$

## Local Maximum and Minimum

- A point $x$ is a turning point of $f(x)$ where one of the following phenonmena thake place :

  - Either there is an interval of increase ending at $x$ and an interval of decrease starting at $x$.
  - Or there is an interval of decrease ending at $x$ and an interval of increase starting at $x$.

- A Turning point as in $1$ above is called a local maximum and a turning point as in $2$ above is called a local minimum.
- At the local maxima or minima, the Linear Approximation is equal to $0.$
- The tangent line is horizontal or parallel to the $x$-axis at the local maxima or minima.
- If $f$ is differentiable at a turning point $a$, it satisfies $f'(a) = 0$.
- A point $a$ is called a critical point of a function $f(x)$ if either %f% is not differentiable at $a$ or $f'(a) = 0$.

### Saddle Points

- A point $a$ is called a saddle point of a function $f(x)$ if $f'(a) = 0$ and $f''(a) \neq 0$.

### Second Derivative Test

- Just like the first derivative $f'$ checks for the monotonicity of $f$ the second derivative $f''$ checks for the monotonicity of $f'$.
- So if $f$ is twice differentiable, we check $f''$ at all the critical points.
  - If $a$ is a critical point and $f''(a) > 0$, then $a$ is a local minimum.
  - If $a$ is a critical point and $f''(a) < 0$, then $a$ is a local maximum.
  - If $a$ is a critical point and $f''(a) = 0$, then $a$ is a saddle point.

## Computing Local Maxima and Minima

- $f(x) = x^3 -12x$
  - $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12$
  - setting $f'(x) = 0$ we get $x = +2$ and $x = -2$
  - Critical points are $x = +2$ and $x = -2$
  - $f''(x) = 6x$
  - $f''(2) = 12 > 0$ so $2$ is a local minimum
  - $f''(-2) = -12 < 0$ so $-2$ is a local maximum
- $f(x) = cos(x)$
  - $f'(x) = -sin(x)$
  - setting $f'(x) = 0$ we get $-sin(x) = 0$ or $x = k\pi$ where $k$ is an integer
  - $k \in \mathbb{Z}$
  - $f''(k\pi) = -cos(x\pi) = \begin{cases} +1 & \text{if } k \text{ is even} \\ -1 & \text{if } k \text{ is odd} \end{cases}$
- $f(x) = x^3 +x^2 - x +5$
  - $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 1$
  - $0 = 3x^2 + 2x - 1$
  - Roots are $x = -1 \text{ and } x = \frac{1}{3}$
  - $f''(-1) = -6+2 = -4 : \text{ local maximum}$
  - $f''(\frac{1}{3}) = 6\frac{1}{3} + 2 = 4 : \text{ local minimum}$
