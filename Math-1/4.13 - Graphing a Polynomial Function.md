# Graphing a Polynomial Function

- Find the X-Intercepts and Y-Intercept, if any.
- Check for the symmetry of the graph. If the function is an even function, the graph will be symmetric about the Y-axis. If the function is an odd function, the graph will be symmetric about the origin.
- Use the Multiplicities of the zeros to determine the behavior of the graph at the X-intercepts.
- Determine the end behavior of the graph by looking at the leading coefficient.
- Ensure that the number of turning points does not exceed one less than the degree of the polynomial.
- To Check the graph we can use tools like Desmos or Geogebra.

## Intermediate Value Theorem
- Let $f$ be a polynomial function. The Intermediate Value Therom sates that if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, then there exists at least one value c between a and b such that $f(c)=0$.
