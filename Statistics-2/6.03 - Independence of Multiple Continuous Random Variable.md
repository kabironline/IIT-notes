# Independence of Multiple Continuous Random Variable
### Defination
- $(X,Y)$ with joint density $f_{XY}(x,y)$ are independent if
  $$f_{XY}(x,y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y)$$
- where $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$ are the marginal densities of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
#### Notes
- Given the joint density, the marginals can be computed
- If the joint density is the product of the marginal densities, then $X$ and $Y$ are independent
- So, if independent, the marginals determine the joint density
