# Expected value of a continuous random variable
## Expected value
### Theorm
- Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with density function $f_X(x)$. Let $g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function. Then the expected value of $g(X)$ is given by
$$ E[g(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x)f_X(x) dx $$
- The integral may diverge to $\pm \infty$ or may not exist at all.
- The summation in discrete case is replaced by an integral in the continuous case.
## Variance and standard deviation
- Variance, denoted by $Var(X)$ or $\sigma^2$ is defined as
$$ Var(x) = E[(X-\mu_X)^2] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x-\mu_X)^2 f_X(x) dx $$
- Variance is the measure of spread of $X$ about its mean
