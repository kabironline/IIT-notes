# Joint density in two dimensions
### Dimensions
- A function  $f(x,y)$ is said to be a joint density function if
  - $f(x,y) \geq 0$ for all $(x,y)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $i.e.$, $f$ is non-negative
  - $\int \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x,y) dx dy = 1$
  - Technical: $f(x,y)$ is a piecewise continuous function of $x$ and $y$.

#### Note
- For every joint density $f(x,y)$, there exist two jointly distributed continuous random variable $X$ and $Y$ such thatm for any two-dimensional region $A$,
  $$P((X,Y) \in A) = \int \int_A f(x,y) dx dy$$
- $f(x,y)$ also denoted $f_{X,Y}(x,y)/f_{XY}(x,y)$ is called the joint density of $X$ and $Y$.
- $supp(X,Y) = \{(x,y): f(x,y) > 0\}$ is called the support of $X$ and $Y$.
  
## 2D Uniform Distribution
- For some region $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the total area $|D|$. We say that $(X,Y) \sim Uniform(D)$ if they have the joint density
$$ f_{XY} (x,y) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{|D|} & (x,y) \in D \\ 0 & (x,y) \notin D \end{cases}$$
- Rectangle: $D = [a,b] \times [c,d] = \{(x,y): a < x < b, c < y < d \}$
- Circle: D = $\{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 < 1\}$
