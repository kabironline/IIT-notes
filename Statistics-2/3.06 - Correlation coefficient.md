# Correlation coefficient
### Defination
- The correlation coefficient or simple correlation of two random variables $X$ and $Y$, denoted by $\rho(X,Y)$
$$ \rho(X,Y) = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{SD(X)SD(Y)} $$
- Range of $\rho(X,Y)$ is $[-1,1]$
### Properties
- $\rho(X,Y)$
  - Is a number that summerises the trend  between $X$ and $Y$
  - It is a dimensionless quantity. It has no units.
- $\rho(X,Y) = \pm 1$ if $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly correlated
  - Threre exists $a \neq 0$ and $b$ such that $Y = aX + b$
  - $Y$ is a linear function of $X$
- $\rho(X,Y) = 0$ if $X$ and $Y$ are not correlated
  - There is no linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$
  - There is no clear trend between $X$ and $Y$.
- $|\rho(X,Y)|$ us close to one
- $\rho(X,Y) = \rho(Y,X)$
  - $X$ and $Y$ are strongly correlated.
  - Increase in $X$ is associated with increase in $Y$.
