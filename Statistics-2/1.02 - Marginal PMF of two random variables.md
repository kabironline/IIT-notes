# Marginal PMF of two random variables
### Defination
- Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are jointly distributed discrete random variables with joint  $\text{PMF }f_{XY}$. The PMF of the indivisual random variables $X$ and $Y$ are called the marginal PMFs.
- The marginal PMF of $X$ is given by
$$f_X=P(X=t) = \sum_{t' \ \in \ T_Y} f_{XY}(t,t')$$
$$f_Y=P(Y=t') = \sum_{t' \ \in \ T_X} f_{XY}(t,t')$$
- $T_X$ and $T_Y$ are the range of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
- Note: The marginal PMF is simply a PMF.

### Example
- Toss of a fair coin twice.
  - Table of $f_{X_1X_2}(t_1,t_2)$
  - | $t_2 \backslash  t_1$ | 0 | 1 | $f_{X_2}(t_2)$
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0 | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$
    | 1 | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$
    | $f_{X_1}(t_1)$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
