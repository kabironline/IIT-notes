# Conditional distribution of a given event
### Defination
- Suppose $X$ is a discreat random variable with range $T_X$, and $A$ is an event in the same probabily space. The conditional PMF of $X$ given $A$ is defined as the PMF
$$Q(t) = P (X =t | A)$$
- We will use the notation $f_{X|A}$ for the above conditional PMF, and $(X|A)$ to denote the "conditional" random variable.
$$f_{X|A}(t) =  \frac{P((X=t) \  âˆ©  \ A)}{P(A)}$$
- Important: Range of $(X|A)$ can be different from $T_X$ and will depend on $A$.
# Conditional Distribution of one random variable given another
### Defination (Conditional distribution of Y given $X = t$)
- Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are jointly distributed discrete random variables with joint $\text{PMF }f_{XY}$. The conditional PMF of $Y$ given $X = t$ is defined as the PMF:
$$Q(t') = P(Y = t' | X = t) = \frac{P(Y = t' | X = t)}{P(X = t)} = \frac{f_{XY}(t,t')}{f_X(t)}$$
- We will use the notation $f_{Y|X=t}(t')$ for the above conditional PMF, and $(Y|X=t)$ to denote the "conditional" random variable.
 $$f_{XY}(t,t') = f_{Y|X=t}(t') \times f_X(t)$$
