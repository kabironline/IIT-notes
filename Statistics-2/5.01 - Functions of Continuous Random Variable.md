# Functions
- We can model one random variable as a function of another random variable.
### Examples
- Let $X$ be the length of a square
  - Let $Y$ be the area of the square $Y = X^2$
- Let $X$ be the volume of a liquid
  - Density of liquid = $\rho$
  - Weight of liquid = $W = \rho X$
---
- Given the distribution of $X$ it is useful to have a method to find the distribution of $Y$.
---
### Example
- Suppose $X \sim \text{Uniform}[0,1]$
  - Find the distribution of $Y = 2\cdot X$
  - What is the distribution of $Y$?
    - For $y \in [0,2]$
    - $F_Y(y) = P(Y \leq y) = P(2X \leq y)
    - $= P(X \leq \frac{y}{2}) = \int_{0}^{\frac{y}{2}} f_X(x) dx = \frac{y}{2}$

## Monotonic, Differentiable Functions
### Theorem
- Suppose $X$ is a continuous random variable with pdf $f_X(x)$. Let $g(x)$ be monotonic for $x \in supp(x)$ with derivative $g'(x) = \frac{dg(x)}{dx}$, The the PDF of $Y = g(X)$ is given by
$$ f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{|g'(g^{-1}(y)|}f_X(g^{-1}(y)) $$

### Example
- Example of Translation $Y = X + a$
  - $g(x) = x + a$
  - $g^{-1}(y) = y - a$
  - $f_Y(y) = f_X(y-a)$
- Example of Scaling $Y = aX$
  - $g(x) = ax$
  - $g^{-1}(y) = \frac{y}{a}$
  - $f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{a}f_X(\frac{y}{a})$
- Example of Squaring $Y = X^2$
  - $g(x) = x^2$
  - $g^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{y}$
  - $f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}}f_X(\sqrt{y})$
