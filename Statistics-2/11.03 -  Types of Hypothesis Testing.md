# Types of Hypothesis
## Simple Hypothesis
### Defination
- A hypothesis that completely specifies the distribution of the samples is called a simple hypothesis.
### Examples
- Coin Toss
  - $P(H) = 0.5, P(H) = 0.9$
- $Normal(\mu, 3)$ samples
  - $\mu = 0, \mu = 1$
### Simple null vs simple alternative
- Very well understood, best apporach is known
- Rarely encountered
## Composite Hypothesis
### Defination
A hypothesis that does not completely specify the distribution of the samples is called a composite hypothesis.
### Examples
- Coin Toss
  - $Null: P(H) = 0.5$
  - $Alternative: P(H) \neq 0.5$
- $Normal(\mu, 3)$ samples
  - $Null: \mu = 0$
  - $Alternative: \mu \geq 1$
### Composite null vs composite alternative
- Well studied, but multiple approaches are possible
- Most common
# Standard Tests: One Sample
$$X_1, \dots, X_n \sim X, E[X] = \mu, Var[X] = \sigma^2$$
### Test for mean, $null H_0 : \mu = c$
- Alternative
  - Right tail test: $H_1: \mu > c$
  - Left tail test: $H_1: \mu < c$
  - Two tail test: $H_1: \mu \neq c$
- Two casesL known or unknown variance
### Test for variance
- $H_0: \sigma = c$
- $H_1: \sigma \geq c$
# Standard Tests: Two Samples
$$X_1, \dots, X_n \sim X, E[X] = \mu_1, Var[X] = \sigma_1^2$$
$$Y_1, \dots, Y_n \sim Y, E[Y] = \mu_2, Var[Y] = \sigma_2^2$$
### Test for difference in means
- $H_0: \sigma_1 = \sigma_2$
- $H_A: \sigma_1 \neq \sigma_2$
# Goodness of fit testing
$$ Samples : X_1, \dots, X_n$$
- Problem: Is the sample from a given distribution?
- Examples
  - Integer samples $X_i \in \{1, \dots, k\}$. Is the distribution Poission?
  - Continuous samples $X_i \in [0, \infin)$. Is the distribution Gamma?
  - Continuous samples $X_i \in (-\infin, \infin).$ Is the distribution Normal?
