# Marginal Densities
### Defination
- Suppose $(X,Y)$ have joint densities $f_{XY}(x,y)$
  - $X$ has the marginal density $f_X(x) = \int_{y=-\infty}^{\infty} f_{XY}(x,y) dy$
  - $Y$ has the marginal density $f_Y(y) = \int_{x=-\infty}^{\infty} f_{XY}(x,y) dx$
#### Notes
- The PDF of $X$ and $Y$ indivisually are called the marginal densities of $X$ and $Y$.
- The joint density exactly determins both the marginal densities.
