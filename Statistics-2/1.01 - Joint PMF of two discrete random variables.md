# Multiple Random Variable
### Examples
- A fair coin tossed thrice. Naturally, there can be three random variables, each of which can take values 0 or 1.
  - Let $X_i = 1$ if the $i^{th}$ toss results in a head and $X_i = 0$ otherwise.
  - The events $X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1, X_3 = 0$ are independent from each other.
- A $2$-digit number from $00$ to $99$ is selected at random. Partial infomarion is available about the number as two random variable. Let $X$ be the units place. Let $Y$ be the reminder obtained when the number is divided by $4$.
  - $X$ can take values $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.
  - $Y$ can take values $0, 1, 2, 3$.
  - $X$ and $Y$ are dependent.

# Joint PMF
### Defination
- Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are discrete random variables defined in the same probablity space. Let the range of $X$ and $Y$ be $T_X$ and $T_Y$ respectively. The joint PMF of $X$ and $Y$, denoted by $f_{XY}$, is the function from $T_X \times T_Y$ to $[0, 1]$ defined by
$$f_{XY}(t_1,t_2) = P(X = t_1 \text{ and } Y = t_2), t_1 \in T_X, t_2 \in T_Y$$
- Joint PMF is usually written as a table or a matrix.

### Examples
- Let $X_i = 1$ if $i^{th}$ toss results in a head and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. $i = 1,2$.
  - $f_{X_1X_2}(0,0) = P(X_1 = 0 \text{ and } X_2 = 0) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$
  - $f_{X_1X_2}(0,1) = P(X_1 = 0 \text{ and } X_2 = 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$
  - Table of $f_{X_1X_2}(t_1,t_2)$
  - | $t_2 \backslash  t_1$ | 0 | 1 |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0 | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ |
    | 1 | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ |
- Let $X = \text{ units place }, Y = \text{Number modulus 4}$
  - $f_{XY}(0,0) = P (X = 0, Y = 0)$
    - $= P(\text{units place is 0 and number is divisible by 4})$
    - $= P(\lbrace 00,20,40,60,80 \rbrace) = 5/100 = 1/20$
  - $f_{XY}(1,0) = P (X = 1, Y = 0)$
    - There is no number with units place 1 and divisible by 4.
  - $f_{XY}(4,2) = P (X = 4, Y = 2)$
    - $= P(\lbrace 14,34,54,74,94 \rbrace) = 5/100 = 1/20$
