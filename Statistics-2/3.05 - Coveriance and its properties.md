# Covariance
### Defination
- Let $X$ and $Y$ are random variables on the same probabily space, The covariacne of $X$ and $Y$, denoted by $Cov(X,Y)$, defined by
$$Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))]$$
- Covariance tends to be positive
  - $(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))$ tends to be positive
  - When $X$ is above/below it's average, $Y$ tends to be below/above it's average.
### Properties of Covariance
- $Cov(X,X) = Var(X)$
- $Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$
- $Cov(X,Y) = Cov(Y,X)$
- Linearity of Covariance
  - $Cov(aX+bY,Z) = aCov(X,Z) + bCov(Y,Z)$
  - $Cov(X+Y,Z) = Cov(X,Z) + Cov(Y,Z)$

### Covariance and Independence
- If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $Cov(X,Y) = 0$
