# Properties of Expected Values
### Constant term and Positive random variable
1. Consider a constant $a$ and a positive random variable $X$
    - $E[a] = a \cdot 1 = 1$
2. Suppose $X$ takes only non-negative values $(X \geq 0) = 1$, Then
    - $E[X] \geq 0$
### Expected Value of a function of random variables
- Suppose $X_1, \dots, $X_n$ have joint PMF $f_{X_1, \dots, X_n}$ with range of $X_i$ denoted by $T_{X_i}$. Let $g : T_{X_1} \times \dots \times T_{X_n} \rightarrow R$ be a function. Then
    $$E[g(X_1, \dots, X_n)] = \sum_{t \in T_Y} ct\cdot f_X(t) = c \sum_{x_n \in T_{X_n}} g(x_1, \dots, x_n) f_{X_1, \dots, X_n}(x_1, \dots, x_n)$$
### Linearity of Expectation
- $E[cX] = cE[X]$, where $c$ is a constant and $X$ is a random variable.
- $E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$, where $X$ and $Y$ are random variables.
### Translation of a random variable
$$E[X + c] = E[X] + c$$
- $X+c$, where $c$ is a constant,  is a "translated" version of $X$.
  - Range of $X + c$ is $T_{X+c} = \{x+c : x \in T_X\}$, which is a translated version of $T_X$.
  - $P(X + c= t + c) = P(X=t)$ and the PMF is "translated" as well.
