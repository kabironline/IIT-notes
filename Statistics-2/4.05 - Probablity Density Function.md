# Probability Density Function
### Defination
- A continuous random variable $X$ witth CDF $F_X(x)$ is said to have a PDF $f_X(x)$ if, for all $x_0$
  $$ F_X(x_0) = \int_{-\infty}^{x_0} f_X(x) dx $$
### Notes
- CDF is the integral of the PDF.
  - Derivative of the CDF (wherever it exists) is the PDF.
- Why PDF?
  - The Value of PDF around $F_X(x_0)$ is the probability of $X$ taking values around $x_0$.
    - Higher the PDF, higher the chances that $X$ lies there.
    - Contrast with the value of CDF at $x_0$ which
    - PDF is easier to work with.
### Properties
- Density function
  - $f_X(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$.
  - $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x) dx = 1$
  - $f(x)$ is a piecewise continuous function.
- Given a density function $f$m there is a continuous random variable $X$ with PDF as $f$
- Support of the random variable $X$ with PDF $f_X$ is $supp(X) = \{x : f_X(x) > 0\}$
  - $supp(X)$ contains intervals in which $X$ can fall with positive probability.
  - Remember $P(X = x) = 0$ for a continuous random variable.
- For a random variable $X$ with $PDF \ f_X$, an event $A$ is a subset of the real line and its probability is computer as $P(A) = \int_A \ f(x)dx$
