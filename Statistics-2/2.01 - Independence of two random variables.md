# Independence of two random variables
### Defination
- Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables defined in a probablity space with ranges $T_X$ and $T_Y$ respectively. $X$ and $Y$ are said to be independent if any event defined using $X$ alone is independent of any envent defined using $Y$ alone. Equivalently, if the joint PMF of $X$ and $Y$ is $f_{XY}$, then $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if:
$$f_{XY}(t_1,t_2) = f_X(t_1) \cdot f_Y(t_2)$$
### Notes
- If $X$ and $Y$ are independent
  - Joint PMF equals product of marginal PMFs
  - Conditional PMF equals marginal PMF
