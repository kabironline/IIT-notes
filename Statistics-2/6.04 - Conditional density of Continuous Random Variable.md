# Conditional Density of Continuous Random Variable
### Defination
- Let $(X,Y)$ be random variable with joint density $f_{XY}(x,y)$ and marginal densities $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$
  - For $a$ such that $f_X(a) > 0$ the conditional density of $Y$ given $X=a$, denoted $f_{Y|X=a}(y)$
  $$f_{Y|X=a}(y) = \frac{f_{XY}(a,y)}{f_X(a)}$$
  - For $b$ such that $f_Y(b) > 0$ the conditional density of $X$ given $Y=b$, denoted $f_{X|Y=b}(x)$
  $$f_{X|Y=b}(x) = \frac{f_{XY}(x,b)}{f_Y(b)}$$
### Properties
- Both the conditional densities are valid densities in one dimension. So the "conditional" random variable $(Y|X=a)$ and $(X|Y=b)$ are well defined.
- Joint  = Marginal * Conditional, for $x=a$ and $y=b$ such that $f_X(a) > 0$ and $f_Y(b) > 0$.
  $$f_{XY}(x,y) = f_{Y|X=a}(y)f_X(a) = f_{X|Y=b}(x)f_Y(b)$$
