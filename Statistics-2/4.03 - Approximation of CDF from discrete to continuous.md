# Cumulative Distribution Function
### Defination
- A function $F : \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ is said to be a Cumulative Distribtion Function if:
  - $F$ is non-decreasing
  - $\lim_{x \to -\infty} F(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x) = 1$
  - $F$ is right continuous, i.e. $\lim_{x \to a^+} F(x) = F(a)$
- Defination motivated by CDF of a random variable defined earlier.
- A general CDF is not necessarily a CDF of a discrete random variable.
  - No need for a step-like function.
  - Can be smooth and continuous.

## Approximation of CDF from discrete to continuous
- Suppose $X$ is a discrete random variable with PMF $f_X$.
#### Binomial Random Variable
- X ~ Binomial(n,p)
  $$F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor x \rfloor} \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$
  $$\text{ or }$$
  $$F(x) = \frac{1}{1+ exp(-\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})}$$
  $$\text{ where } \mu = np, \sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$$
- Better approximation for large $n$.
