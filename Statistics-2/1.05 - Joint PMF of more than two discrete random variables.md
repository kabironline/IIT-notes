# Multiple discrete random variables: Joint PMF

### Defination (Joint PMF)
- Suppose $X_1, X_2, \dots X_n$ are discrete random variables defined in the same probablity space. Let the range of $X_i$ be $T_{X_i}$. The joint PMF of $X_i$, denoted by $F_{X_1X_2\dots X_n}$, is a function from $T_{X_1} \times T_{X_2} \times \dots \times T_{X_n}$ to $[0,1]$ defined by
$$f_{X_1 \dots X_n}(t_1, \dots, t_n) = P(X_1 = t_1 \dots \text{ and } X_n = t_n), t_i \in T_{X_i}.$$
- Joint PMF could be written as a table in small examples.
- $P(X_1 = t_1 \text{ and } \dots \text{ and } X_n = t_n)$ is denoted by $P(X_1 = t_1, \dots, X_n = t_n)$
