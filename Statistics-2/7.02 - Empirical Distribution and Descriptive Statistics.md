# Empirical Distribution
### Defination
- Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n \sim X$ be $i.i.d.$ samples. Let $\ \#(X_i=t)$ denote the number of times $t$ occurs in the samples. The empirical distribution is the discrete distribution with PMF:
  $$p(t) = \frac{\#(X_i=t)} {n}$$
## Sample Mean
### Defination
- Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be $i.i.d.$ samples. The sample mean is denoted by $\bar{X}$ and defined as:
  $$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$
  $$ \text{or} \ \ \bar{X} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n}{n}$$
### Expected value and Variance of Sample Mean
- Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be $i.i.d.$ samples with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Then the sample mean $\bar{X}$ has mean $\mu$ and variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$.
  $$E[\bar{X}] = \mu$$
  $$Var(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$
#### Properties
- Expected value of sample mean equals the expected value or mean of the distribution
  - Mean of the distribution: constant real number but not random
  - Sample mean: random variable with mean equal to distribtuion mean
- Variance of sample mean decreases with $n$
  - As $n$ increases
    - Varaince of sample mean tends to zero
    - The spread of the sample mean decreases
    - Sample mean will take values close to the distribution mean
### Sample Variance
#### Defination
- Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be $i.i.d.$ samples. The sample variance is denoted by $S^2$ and defined as:
  $$S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2$$
  $$ \text{or} \ \ S^2 = \frac{(X_1 - \bar{X})^2 + (X_2 - \bar{X})^2 + \dots + (X_n - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}$$
#### Expected value and Variance of Sample Variance
- Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be $i.i.d.$ samples with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Then the sample variance $S^2$ has mean $\sigma^2$ and variance $\frac{2\sigma^4}{n-1}$.
  $$E[S^2] = \sigma^2$$
  $$Var(S^2) = \frac{2\sigma^4}{n-1}$$
- Its properties are similar to that of sample mean.
### Sample Proportion
#### Defination
- Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be $i.i.d.$ samples. The sample proportion is denoted by $S(A)$ and defined as:
  $$S(A) = \frac{\#(X_i \text{ for which A is true})} {n}$$
  $$ A\text{ is a event defined on the sample space } X$$

#### Expected Value of Sample Proportion
- Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be $i.i.d.$ samples with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Then the sample proportion $S(A)$ has mean $p$ and variance $\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.
  $$E[S(A)] = P(A)$$
  $$Var(S(A)) = \frac{P(A)(1-P(A))}{n}$$
