# Graphical Behavior of Polynomials at X-Intercepts

- If a polynomial contains a factor of the form $(x-a)^m$, the behavior near the X-Intercept $a$ is determined by its multiplicity $m$. We say that $x=0$ is a zero of multiplicity $m$.
- The Graph of a polynomial function will juch byt not cross the X-Axis at zeros which even multiplicities. The graph will cross the X-Axis at zeros of odd multiplicities.
- The Sum of the Multiplicities of the zeros of a polynomial is equal to the degree of the polynomial.

### Given a graph of a polynomial of degree $n$, how can one identify the zeros and their multiplicities?

- If the graph touchtes the X-Axis and bounces off of the axis, it is a zero with even multiplicity.
- If the graph crosses the X-Axis and appears almost linear at the intercept, it is a single zero with odd multiplicity.
