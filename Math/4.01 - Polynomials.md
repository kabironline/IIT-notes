# Polynomials

- Polynomial is one kind of mathematical expression which is a sum of several mathematical terms.
- Each term in this experssion is called monomial and the term can be a number, a variable or a product of a number variable.
- $x^2 + 2y + z$ is an example of a polynomial.

## Why do we call it a polynomial?

- The word Polynomial is made of two words.

- $\text{Poly + Nomial}$
  -
- Poly means many.
- Nomial or Nomen means name / term.
- Each term in a polynomial is called a monomial.
- If the polynomial has only 2 terms then it is called a binomial.
- If the polynomial has only 3 terms then it is called a trinomial.
- But in general we call a polynomial as a polynomial.
- $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^n + ... + a_1x + a_0$
