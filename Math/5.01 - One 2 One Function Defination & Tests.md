# One to One Function Defination & Tests

### Defination

- A function is said to be One-to-One. If for every value of $y$ there is only one value of $x$ such that $f(x)=y$.
- If $f$ is a **increasing** or **decreasing** function, then $f$ is One-to-One.
- One to One function is also called also **reversible** function.

### Properties

- $y = f(x)$

  - | Domain $(A)$      | Codomain $(B)$       | Properties                              |
    | ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | One $x$           | More than one $f(x)$ | Not a Function                          |
    | More than one $x$ | One $f(x)$           | It is a function. It is not reversible. |
    | One $x$           | One $f(x)$           | It is a function. It is reversible      |

- We can use the vertical line test to determine if a function is one to one.

  - If the vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, then the function is not one to one.

- We can also use the horizontal line test to determine if a function is one to one.
  - If the horizontal line intersects the graph at more than one point, then the function is not one to one.
  - We can also use the horizontal line test to determine if a function is onto.
    - If the horizontal line intersects the graph at all points, then the function is onto.

## Horizontal Line Test:

- If any horizontal line intersects the graph at more than one point, then the function is not one to one.

### Examples

- [ ] $f(x)=|x|$
  - # $\{^{x, \ x \  \geqslant \ 0}_{-x, \ x \  < \ 0}$
  - The line passes the vertical line test.
  - But the line is not One to One because $f(2)=2=f(-2)$
  - There are two values of $x$ that give the same value of $y$.
- [ ] $f(x) = x$
  - ## $\{^{x, \ x \  \geqslant \ 0}_{-x, \ x \  < \ 0}$
  - $x_1 \neq x_2 \rArr f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$
  - This function is one to one.
- [ ] Can we Identify the class of functions that are one-to-one?
  - $x_1 < x_2 \rArr f(x_1) < f(x_2) = (\text{increasing function})$
  - $x_1 > x_2 \rArr f(x_1) < f(x_2) = (\text{decreasing function})$
