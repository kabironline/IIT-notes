# Slope of a Quadratic Function

- [ ] Let us find the slope of a Quadratic Function $y = x^2$.
- The Vertex of the Quadratic Function is $(0,0)$.
- Lets tabulate the values of $x_i$ and $y_i$ and $y_i-y_{i-1}$.

| $x_i$ | $y_i$ | $y_i-y_{i-1}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| -2    | 4     |               |
| -1    | 1     | -3            |
| 0     | 0     | -1            |
| 1     | 1     | 1             |
| 2     | 4     | 3             |

- To get the slope of a Quadratic Function, we need to find the average of the differences between the $y_i$ and $y_{i-1}$.
- Suppose we have to find the slope of the Quadratic Function $y = ax^2 + bx+c$ at where $a \neq 0$. how do we find the slope of the Quadratic Function?

| $x_i$ | $y_i$     | $y_i-y_{i-1}$ |      |
| ----- | --------- | ------------- | ---- |
| -2    | $4a-2b+c$ |               |      |
| -1    | #a-b+c$   | $-3a+b$       |      |
| 0     | $c$       | $-a+b$        | $2a$ |
| 1     | $a+b+c$   | $a+b$         | $2a$ |
| 2     | $4a+2b+c$ | $3a+b$        | $2a$ |

- From the table above, we can see that the slope of the Quadratic Function is $2a$.
- Also note that, slope denotes the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$.
- Hence, $\text{slope} = 0$ means that the Function has reached it's maximum or minimum value, which happens when when $2ax+b = 0$. That is when **$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$**.
- $R=\lbrace(A,B)|A\subseteq B \rbrace$
