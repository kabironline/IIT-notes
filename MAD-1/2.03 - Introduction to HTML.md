# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

- HTML first appeared in 1991. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee. It was originally called HyperText Markup Language.
- Considered an application of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).
  - SGML is a standard for defining markup languages. It was created in the 1980s. It has a strict syntax. It is not used much today.
- HTML is a markup language. It is used to describe the structure of a document. It is not a programming language. It is not used to describe the behaviour of a document.
- HTML meant for browsers. It is not meant for humans. It is meant for computers.
  - Very forgiving. It will try to display the document even if it is not valid HTML.
  - HTML is not case sensitive.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## HTML Tags

- HTML tags are used to describe the structure of a document.
- Tags are case insensitive.
- HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets.
  - `<tagname></tagname>` (pair of tags)
  - `<tagname attribute="value">content</tagname>` (tag with attribute)
  - `<tagname attribute="value" />` (self-closing tag)

### Nesting Tags

- Tags can be nested inside other tags.
- ```html
  <p>My <b>first</b> paragraph.</p>
  ```
- Tags can be nested inside themselves.
- Invalid HTML:
  - ```html
    <b><b>bold</b></b>
    ```
  - ```html
    <b><i>bold and italic</b></i>
    ```

### Presenation vs. Semantic Tags

- `<strong> Hello </strong>` is a semantic tag.
- `<b> Hello </b>` is a presentational tag.
- **Hello**
- Both tags make the text bold. But `<strong>` is a semantic tag. It describes the meaning of the text. `<b>` is a presentational tag. It describes the appearance of the text.

### HTML5

- HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It was released in 2014.
- Block elements `<div>`
- Inline elements `<span>`
- Logical element `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`
- Media elements `<img>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`

## Document Object Model (DOM)

- The DOM is a programming interface for HTML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
- It is like a tree. It has a root node. It has parent nodes and child nodes.
- We can directly manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
- Application Programming Interface (API)
  - A set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications which access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.
  - Canvas (API for drawing graphics)
  - Offline (API for making web apps work offline)
  - Web Storage (API for storing data in the browser)
  - Drag and Drop (API for dragging and dropping elements)
  - Geolocation (API for finding the user's location)
  - and many more...
- We mostly use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
  - We can also use other languages like Python, Java, etc. to manipulate the DOM.
- We also use CSS (Casscading Style Sheets)to style the DOM.
  - We can also use other languages like SASS, LESS, etc. to style the DOM.
