# Simplest web server
```sh
while true; do
  echo -e 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n $(done)' |
    nc -l localhost 1500;
done
```
- This is the simplest web server you can write.
- It listens on port 1500 and returns a 200 OK response.
- It doesn't do anything else.
### Typical request
```sh
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1500
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
Accept: */*
```
### Curl simple web server
```sh
curl -v localhost:1500
```
- This is the simplest web client you can write.
- It sends a GET request to localhost:1500.
- It doesn't do anything else.

* Connected to localhost (::1) port 1500 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/ 1.1
