# Web Application
- Client-Server model
- Stateless: server does not know the present state of the client
  - Must be ready to respond to whatever the client requests without assuming anything about the client
- Requests sent through HTTP protocol
  - Use variants of the GET, POST (Verbs) to convey meaning
  - Use URL (Uniform Resource Locator) structure to convey meaning
# Python Decorators
- A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
- "@" decorator_name before the fucntion name
  - ```py
    @decorator_name
    def function_name():
        pass
    ```
- Decorators are very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class.
## Basic Flask Routing
- ```py
  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def index():
      return 'Hello World!'
  ```
- When a user visits the URL `http://localhost:5000/`, the function `index()` is called and the message "Hello World!" is displayed in the browser. This is a `GET` request.
- The `@app.route()` decorator is used to tell Flask what URL should trigger the function.
- ```py
  @app.route('/', method=['GET'])
  def index():
      return 'Hello World!'

  @app.route('/create', method=['Post'])
  def create():
      create()
  ```
- The `@app.route()` decorator can be used to specify more than one URL for the same function.
- Here we showed that triggers can only respond to a specific HTTP method.
## CRUD Operations
```py
@app.route('/', method=['GET']) (index)
@app.route('/create', method=['Post']) (create)
@app.route('/<int:user_id>', method=['GET']) (read)
@app.route('/<int:user_id>/edit', method=['PUT']) (update)
@app.route('/<int:user_id>/delete', method=['DELETE']) (delete)
```
