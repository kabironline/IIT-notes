# Lengths of Vectors

- Let us find the length of vector $(3,4)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$
- Using Pythagoras' theorm the length of the vector $(3,4)$ is:
  - $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5\text{ units}$

### Formula

- The Length of the vector is the **_Square root of it's Dot Product with itself._**
- $u \in \mathbb{R}^n$
  $$||u|| = \sqrt{u \cdot u}$$

# Angle between between two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$

### Formula

$$cos(\theta) = \frac{u \cdot v}{||u|| \cdot ||v|| }$$
$$or$$
$$\theta = \cos^{-1}(\frac{u\cdot v}{\sqrt{(v \cdot v) \times(u \cdot u)}})$$

- Let us find the angle between the vectors $(3,4)$ and $(1,5)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$
- The angle is measured in degrees or radians $( 0 \text{ and } 2\pi)$
- It is clockwise from the positive $x$-axis
- The angle is often described by computing its trigonometrix function $(e.g. \sin, \cos, \tan)$

### The dot product and the angle between two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$

- Let $u$ and $v$ be two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then we can compute the angle $\theta$ between the vectors $u$ and $v$ using the dot products as:
  $$
  \cos(\theta) = \frac{u\cdot v}{\sqrt{(v \cdot v) \times(u
  \cdot u)}}
  $$
  $$ \text{or}$$
  $$
  \theta = \cos^{-1}(\frac{u\cdot v}{\sqrt{(v \cdot v) \times(u \cdot u)}})
  $$

### The dot product of two vectors in \mathbb{3}$

- Consider the two vectors $(1, 2, 3)$ and $(2, 0, 1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The dot product of these two vectors gives us a scalar as follows:
  $$(1,2,3) \cdot (2,0,1) = 1 \times 2 + 2 \times 0 + 3 \times 1 = 5$$

### Length of vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$

- Finding the length of the vector $(4,3,3)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$
- Using the formula we get:
  - $\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9 + 9} = \sqrt{34} = 5.83\text{ units}$

### Angle between two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$

- Finding the angle $\theta$ between $(1,0,0) \text{ and } (1,0,1).$
- Using the formula:
  - $(1,0,0). (1, 0, 1)= 1, (1, 0, 1). (1, 0, 1) = 2,(1, 0, 0) . (1, 0, 0) = 1$
  - Hence, $\theta = \cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = 45^{\circ}$
