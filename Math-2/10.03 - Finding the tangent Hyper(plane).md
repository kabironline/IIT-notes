# Collection of all the tangents

- Let $f(x,y)$ be a fucntion defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ containing some open ball around the point $(a,b)$.
- Suppose $\nabla f$ exists and is continuous on some open ball around the point $(a,b)$.
- Then all the tangent line at the point $(a,b)$ exists and we can rewrite the equation of a tangent line the direction of the unit vector $u$ as:
  $$\begin{align} f_u(a,b) &= \nabla f \cdot u \\ &= u_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + u_2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \end{align}$$

# Tangents in terms of linear algebra for $f(x,y)$

- $(x(t),y(t),z(t)) = (a + tu_1, b + tu_2, f(a,b) + tf_u(a,b))$
- Tangent line to $f$ at $(a,b)$ in the direction of $u$ is given by $(a,b,f(a,b)) + W$
  $$z = f(a,b) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b)(x-a) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b)(y-b)$$

# The tangent hyperplane
- Let $f(x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n)$ be a function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing some open ball around the point $a$.
- Suppose $\nabla f$ exists and is continuous on some open ball around the point $a$.

# Linear Approximation
- Let $f(x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n)$ be a function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing some open ball around the point $a$.
- Suppose $\nabla f$ exists and is continuous on some open ball around the point $a$.
- Then the function:
  $$L_f(x) = f(a) + \nabla f \cdot (x-a)$$
