# Equivalence of Matricies

- Let $A$ and $B$ be two matrices of order $m \times n$. We say $A$ is equivalent to $B$ if $B = QAP$ for some invertible $n \times n$ matrix $P$ and some invertible $m \times m$ matrix $Q$.

### Properties of equivalence

- $A$ can be transformed into $B$ by a sequence of elementary row operations.
- $rank(A) = rank(B)$
- If the rank of $A$ and $B$ are the same then they are equivalent.

### Equivalence matrices is an equivalence relation

- $A$ is equivalent to itself.
- $A$ is equivalent to $B$ if and only if $B$ is equivalent to $A$.
- $A$ is equivalent to $B$ and $B$ is equivalent to $C$ if and only if $A$ is equivalent to $C$.

#### Example

- Consider the linear transformation $f : \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2,$ defined as :
  - $f(x,y,z) = (x + y, x + z)$
- Consider two ordered bases for $\mathbb{R}^3$:
  - $\beta_1 = (1,0,0), (0,1,0),(0,0,1)$ and $\beta_1 = (1,1,0), (0,1,1),(0,0,1)$
- Consider two ordered basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$:
  - $\gamma_1 = (1,0), (0,1)$ and $\gamma_2 = (1,0), (1,1)$
- $f(1,0,0) = (1,0)$
- $f(0,1,0) = (1,1) = 1(1,0) + 1(0,1)$
- $f(0,0,1) = (0,1)$
- The matrix of $\beta_1$ with respect to $\gamma_1$ is:
  - $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- $f(1,1,0) = (2,1) = 1(1,0) + 1(1,1)$
- $f(0,1,1) = (1,2) = -1(1,0) + 2(1,1)$
- $f(0,0,1) = (0,1) = -1(1,0) + 1(1,1)$
- The matrix of $\beta_2$ with respect to $\gamma_2$ is:
  - $B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & -1 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- Choose $P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}$ and $Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- $QAP = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & -1 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & -1 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = B$
- Hence $A$ and $B$ are equivalent.

### Note

- We can get the matrix of $P$ by expressing the ordered basis $\beta_2$ in terms of the ordered basis $\beta_1$
- We can get the matrix of $Q$ by expressing the ordered basis $\gamma_2$ in terms of the ordered basis $\gamma_1$

# Similarity

- An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is said to be similar to a matrix $B$ if there exists an invertible $n \times n$ matrix $P$ such that $B = P^{-1}AP \text{ or } PB = AP$.
- Similar matrix have the same **trace.**
  - $$\text{Trace = } tr(A) = \sum_{i=1}^nA_{ii}$$
- $A$ is similar to itself.
- $A$ is similar to $B$ if and only if $B$ is similar to $A$.
- $A$ is similar to $B$ and $B$ is similar to $C$ if and only if $A$ is similar to $C$.

### Properties of similarity

- Suppose $A$ is similar to $B$ matricies.
- $A$ and $B$ are equivalent.
- $rank(A) = rank(B)$
- $det(B) = det(A)$
  - $det(B) = det(P^{-1}AP) \Rightarrow det(P^{-1})det(A)det(P) \Rightarrow  \frac{1}{det(P)}det(A)det(P) = det(A)$
- Several other invariants of $A$ and $B$ are the same such as the characteristic polynomial, minimal polynomial and eigen values (with multiplicity).

#### Example

- Consider the linear transformation $f : \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3 \text{ where } f(x,y,z) = (-x+y+z,x-y+z,x+y-z)$
  - The basis $\beta = \gamma$ both are the standard ordered basis for
  - $f(1,0,0) = (-1,1,1) = -1(1,0,0) + 1(0,1,0) + 1(0,0,1)$
  - $f(0,1,0) = (1,-1,1) = 1(1,0,0) - 1(0,1,0) + 1(0,0,1)$
  - $f(0,0,1) = (1,1,-1) = 1(1,0,0) + 1(0,1,0) - 1(0,0,1)$
  - Hence the matrix of $f$ is:
    - $A = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$
  - We get $P$ by expressing the ordered basis $\beta$ in terms of the ordered basis $\gamma$.
    - $P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- Consider the linear transformation $f : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2 \text{ where } f(x,y) = (2x,y)$
  - The basis $(1,0), (1,1)$ for $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then we have the following:
  - $f(1,0) = (2,0) = 2(1,0) + 0(1,1)$
  - $f(1,1)= (2,1) = 1(1,0) + 1(1,1)$
  - The matrix of $f$ is:
    - $B = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
