# Rate of change in a perticular direction at a point

- Let $f(x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n)$ be a function defined on a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ containing a point $a$ and an open ball around it.
- Suppose instead of in the direction of axes, we are interested in the rate of change of the function $f$ at $a$ in some other direction.
- We can use the same idea as for partial derivatives and chose a unit vector $\vec{u} = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n)$ in the direction of interest.
  $$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a_1 + hu_1, a_2 + hu_2, \dots, a_n + hu_n) - f(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)}{h}$$

#### Example

- The rate of change of $f(x,y) = x+y$ at $(0,0)$ in the direction of the $y=x$ line.
  - The unit vector is $\vec{u} = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$
  - $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(0 + h\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0 + h\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) - f(0,0)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}h}{h}$
- The rate of change of $f(x,y,z) = xy + yz + zx$ at $(1,2,3)$ in the direction of the vector $(4,3,0)$
  - To get the unit vector we divide the vector by its **norm**.
  - $u = \frac{v}{||v||} = \frac{(4,3,0)}{\sqrt{16+9}} = \frac{(4,3,0)}{5}$
  - $lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(1 + h\frac{4}{5}, 2 + h\frac{3}{5}, 3) - f(1,2,3)}{h} = \frac{32}{5}$

### Properties

- **Linearity**: Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. If the directional derivative at the point $a$ in the direction of the unit vector $u$ exists for both the functions $f(x) \text{ and } g(x)$, then it also exists for $(cf + g)(x)$ and
  $$(cf + g)_u (a) = cf_u(a)+g_u(a)$$
- **The Product Rule**: If the directional derivative at the point $a$ in the direction of the unit vector $u$ exists for both the functions $f(x) \text{ and } g(x)$, then it also exists for $(fg)(x)$ and
  $$(fg)_u (a) = f_u(a)g(a) + f(a)g_u(a)$$
- **The Quotient Rule**: If the directional derivative at the point $a$ in the direction of the unit vector $u$ exists for both the functions $f(x) \text{ and } g(x)$, then it also exists for $(\frac{f}{g})(x)$ and
  $$(\frac{f}{g})_u (a) = \frac{f_u(a)g(a) - f(a)g_u(a)}{g^2(a)}$$

#### Example

- $f(x,y) = x +y$
  - $\Rightarrow \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+hu_1,y + hu_2) - f(x,y)}{h}$
  - $\Rightarrow \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(x+hu_1) + (y + hu_2) - (x+y)}{h}$
