# Span of a set of vectors

- The span of a set $S$ (of vectors) is defined as the set of all finite linear
  combinations of elements(vectors) of $S$, and denoted by $Span(S)$.
  $$Span(S) = \{ \sum_{i=1}^n a_i v_i  \in V|a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}\}$$

#### Example

- Let $S = \{(1,0)\} \in \mathbb{R}^2$

  - $Span(S) = \{a(1,0) | a \in \mathbb{R}\} = \{(a,0) | a \in \mathbb{R}\}$

- Let $S = \{(1,1)\} \in \mathbb{R}^2$

  - $Span(S) = \{a(1,1) | a \in \mathbb{R}\} = \{(a,a) | a \in \mathbb{R}\}$

- Let $S = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0)\} \in \mathbb{R}^3$
  - $Span(S) = \{a(1,0,0) + b(0,1,0) | a,b \in \mathbb{R}\} = \{(a, b, 0) | a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}$

## Spaning set for a vector space

- Let $V$ be a vector space. A set $S$ of vectors in $V$ is called a spanning set for $V$ if $V = Span(S)$.

#### Example

- If $S = \{(1,0), (0,1)\}$, then $Span(S) = \mathbb{R}^2$.
- If $S = \{(1,1), (0,1)\}$, then $Span(S) = \mathbb{R}^2$.
- If $S = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\}$, then $Span(S) = \mathbb{R}^3$.

#### Example: Adding vectors to obtain a spanning set for $\mathbb{R}^3$

- Start with $S_0$ to be the empty set $\emptyset$.
- Thus $Span(S_0) = \{(0,0,0)\}$.
- We will add the vector $(3,0,0)$ to $S_0$ to obtain $S_1$.
- Now $Span(S_1) = \{(3,0,0)\}$.
- Now we will add the vector $(2,2,1)$ to $S_1$ to obtain $S_2$.
  - This does not cover the entire vector space $\mathbb{R}^3$.
- So we add the vector $(1,3,3)$ to $S_2$ to obtain $S_3$.
- So $Span(S_3) = \mathbb{R}^3$.
- $(x,y,z) = \frac{3x-5y+4z}{9}(3,0,0) + (y-z)(2,2,1) + \frac{2z-y}{3}(1,3,3)$

# Basis of a vector space

- A basis $B$ of a vector space $V$ is linearly independent subset of $B$ that spans $V$.

## Conditions for a set to be a basis

- The set $B$ is linearly independent. $Span(B) = V$.
- $B$ is a maximal linearly independent set.
- $B$ is a minimal spanning set.

## Finding a basis for a vector space

### Method 1

- Start with the $Ø$ and keep appending vectors which are not in the span of the set thus far obtained, until we obtain a spanning set.

#### Example

- Let $V = \mathbb{R}^2$.
- Let us start with the empty set $\emptyset$ and append a non-zero vector $(1,2)$ to it.
- Now choose another vector which is not in the span of the of the earlier vector like $(2,3)$.

### Method 2

- Take a spanning set and keep deleting vectors which are linear combinations of the other vectors, until the remaining vectors satisfy that they are not a linear combination of the other remaining ones.

#### Example

- Let $V = \mathbb{R}^3$.
- Let us start with the spanning set $\{(1,0,0), (1,2,0), (1,0,3), (0,2,3), (0,4,3)\}$.

### Notes

- The span of a empty set is the zero vector space $\{0\}$.

#### Example

- Let $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the vector with $i^{th}$ coordinate equal to $1$ and all other coordinates equal to $0$.
  - The set $\epsilon =  \{e_1, e_2, \cdots, e_n\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    - $e_1 = (1,0,\cdots, 0)$
    - $e_2 = (0,1,\cdots, 0)$
    - $\vdots$
    - $e_n = (0,0,\cdots, 1)$
  - $Span(\epsilon) = \mathbb{R}^n$
  - $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i e_i = (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n)$
