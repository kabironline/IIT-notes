# Points of local extrema for multivariable functions

- Let $f(x)$ be a function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing some open ball around the point $a$.
- The point $a$ is the local maximum (or point of local maximum) of $f$ if for some some open ball $B$ containing $a$, $f(x) \leq f(a)$ whenever $x \in B \cap D$.
- The point $a$ is the local minimum (or point of local minimum) of $f$ if for some some open ball $B$ containing $a$, $f(x) \geq f(a)$ whenever $x \in B \cap D$.
- A local extremum (or point of local extremum) of $f$ is a point $a$ such that $f$ is either a local maximum or a local minimum at $a$.

# The gradient vector at points of local extrema

- Let $f(x)$ be a function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing some open ball around the point $a$ of local extremum.
- Restrict $f$ to a a line $L$ passing throught $a$ and view it as a fucntion of one variable on $L$.
- Then $a$ is a local extremum for the restricted function on $L$ and hence the directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of the $L$(if it exists) at $a$ is zero.
- In particular, those partial derivatives which exist at $a$ are zero.

# Critical points
- A point $a$ is called a critical point of a function $f(x)$ if either $\nabla f(a)$ does not exist or $\nabla f(a) = 0$.
### Example
- Critical Points of $f(x,y) = x^2 + 6xy + 4y^2 + 2x - 4y$
  - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x + 6y + 2 = 0$
  - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 6x + 8y - 4 = 0$
  - $\nabla f(a) = (0,0)$
  - $\nabla f(x,y) = (2x + 6y + 2, 6x + 8y - 4) = (0,0)$
  - Using Gaussian elimination, we get $x = 2$ and $y = -1$.
  - Therefore, $(2,-1)$ is a critical point of $f(x,y)$.
