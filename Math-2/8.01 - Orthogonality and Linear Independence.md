# Orthogonality

### Definition

- Two vectors $u,v \in V$ are **orthogonal** if $<u,v> = 0$ or $u \cdot v = 0$.
- It depends on the inner product of the vector space.
- Different inner products can lead to different definitions of orthogonality.

### Example

- Consider the $\mathbb{R}^2$ with inner product
  - $<u,v> = x_1y_1 - (x_2y_2 + x_2y_1) + 2x_2y_2$
- Then the vectors $(1,1)$ and $(1,0)$ are orthogonal.
  - $<u,v> = 1 \times 1 - (1 \times 0 + 1 \times 1) + 2 \times 0 = 0$

### An Orthogonal set of vectors

- An orthogonal set of vectors of an inner product space $V$ is a set of vectors whose elements are mutually orthogonal.
- Explicitly, if $S = \{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n\}$ is an orthogonal set of vectors, then $<v_i,v_j> = 0$ for all $i \neq j$.
  $$<v_i,v_j> = 0 \text{ for all } i,j \in \{1,2, \dots, k\} \text{ and } i \neq j$$

### Example

- Consider $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the usual inner product. Then the set $S = \{(4,3, -2), (-3, 2, -3), (-5, 18, 17)\}$ is an orthogonal set of vectors.

### Orthogonality and Linear Independence

- Let $V$ be an orthogonal set of vectors in the inner product space $V$.
- Then $V$ is linearly independent if and only if $V$ is orthogonal.

#### Proof

- If $V$ is orthogonal, then $<v_i,v_j> = 0$ for all $i \neq j$.
  - Thus, $v_i$ is orthogonal to $v_j$ for all $i \neq j$.
  - Thus, $v_i$ is linearly independent of $v_j$ for all $i \neq j$.
  - Thus, $V$ is linearly independent.

### Orthogonal Basis

- Let V be an inner product space. A basis consisting of mutually orthogonal vectors is called an **orthogonal basis**.
  Since an orthogonal set of vectors is already linearly independent, an orthogonal set is a basis precisely when it is a **maximal orthogonal set** (i.e. there is no orthogonal set strictly containing this one).
- If $dim(V) = n$, then
  $$\text{orthogonal basis = orthogonal set of n vectors.}$$

#### Example

- The standard basis
- $S = \{(4,3, -2), (-3, 2, -3), (-5, 18, 17)\}$
- Consider $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the inner product $<(x_1,x_2),(y_1,y_2)> = x_1y_1 - (x_2y_2 + x_2y_1) + 2x_2y_2$
- Then the basis $\{(1,0), (0,1)\}$ is an orthogonal basis.
