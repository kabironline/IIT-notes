# Limit of a vector valued fucntion at a point

- Let $f : D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a vector valued multivariable function defined on the domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ and $a$ be a point such that there exists a sequence in $D$ which converges to $a$.
- If $f_i$ is the $i^{th}$ component of $f$ then the limit of $f$ at $a$ is defined as scalar valued function from $D$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Suppose for each $i$ the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f_i(x)$ exists. and equals $L_i$ then:
  $$\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$$
- This is equivalent to $:$ as $x$ comes closer and closer to $a$, $f(x)$ eventually comes closer and closer to $L$.
- If for some $i$, the limit $f_i$ at $a$ does not exist, then the limit of $f$ at $a$ does not exist.

# Limit of function at a point along a curve

- Let $f$ be a scalar-valued mutlivariable function defined on the domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ and $a$ be a point such that there exists a sequence in $D$ which converges to $a$.
- Let $C$ be a curve passing through the point $a$ belonging to the domain $D$
- The limit of $f$ at $a$ along the curve $C$ exists and equals $L$ if for every sequence $a_n$ contained in $C$ which converges to $a$, the sequence $f(a_n)$ converges to $L$.

## Theorm
- The limit of $f$ at $a$ exists and equals $L$ precisely when for every curve $C$ in the domain $D$ passing through $a$ the limit of $f$ at $a$ along $C$ exists and equals $L$.

# Continuity of a function
- Let $f$ be a multivariable function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ and $a \in D$ be a point such that there exists a sequence in $D$ which converges to $a$.
- **Defination** $:$ $f$ is conitnuous at $a$ if the limit of $f$ at $a$ exists and $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)$. $f$ is continuous at $a$ is equivalent to $f(a_n) \rightarrow f(a)$ as $a_n \rightarrow a$.
- **NOTE** $:$ continuity means that *the limit at $a$ can be obtained by evaluating the function at $a$*.
