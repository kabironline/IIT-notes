# Hessian Test : Classifying Critical Points for $f(x,y)$

- Let $f(x,y)$ be a function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
- Let $a$ be a critical point of $f$ such that the first and second order partial derivatives are continuous in an open ball around $a$.
- Then the Hessian test can be applied to check the nature of the critical point $a$.

  1. If $det(Hf(a)) > 0$ and $f_{xx}(a) > 0$ then $a$ is a local minimum.
  2. If $det(Hf(a)) > 0$ and $f_{xx}(a) < 0$ then $a$ is a local maximum.
  3. If $det(Hf(a)) < 0$ then $a$ is a saddle point.
  4. If $det(Hf(a)) = 0$ then $a$ then the test is inconclusive.

# Hessian Test : Classifying Critical Points for $f(x,y,z)$

- Let $f(x,y,z)$ be a function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
- Let $a$ be a critical point of $f$ such that the first and second order partial derivatives are continuous in an open ball around $a$.
- Then the Hessian test can be applied to check the nature of the critical point $a$.
  1. If $f_{xx}(a) > 0, (f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2)(a) > 0$ and $det(Hf(a)) > 0$ then $a$ is a local minimum.
  2. If $f_{xx}(a) < 0, (f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2)(a) > 0$ and $det(Hf(a)) < 0$ then $a$ is a local maximum.
  3. For all other cases where the determinant of the Hessian $\neq 0$ then it is a saddle point.
  4. If $det(Hf(a)) = 0$ then $a$ then the test is inconclusive.
