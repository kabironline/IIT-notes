# Limits of sequences in $R^p$

- Let $\{ a_n \}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^p$.
- $a_n = (a_{n1}, a_{n2}, \dots, a_{np})$
- We say that $\{ a_n\}$ has a limit $a = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_p) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ if as $n$ increases, the sequence in the $i^{th}$ coordinate has a limit $a_i$.
- A sequence $\{ a_n \}$ is convergent if it converges to some point in $\mathbb{R}^p$.
- A sequence $\{ a_n \}$ is divergent if it does not converge to any point in $\mathbb{R}^p$.
- Subsequences of a sequence $\{ a_n \}$ are sequences that can be obtained by removing some elements from the original sequence.

## Limits of scalar-valued multivariable functions at a point

- Let $f$ be a scala-valued multivariable function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ and $a$ be a point such that there exists a sequence in $D$ which converges to $a$.
- If tehre exists a real number $L$ such that $f(a_n) \rightarrow L$ for all sequences $a_n$ such that $a_n \rightarrow a$, then we say that the limit of $f$ at $a$ exists and is equal to $L$. We write
  $$\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$$

- $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$ is equivalent to : as $x$ comes closer and closer to $a$ and $f(x)$ eventually comes closer to to $L$.

If there is no such number $L$ then we say that the limit of $f$ at $a$ does not exist.

### Rules for limits of scalar-valued multivariable functions

$\text{If }$ $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = F$, $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x) = G$

- $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} (cf+g)(x) = cF + G$
- $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} (fg)(x) = FG$
- $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} (\frac{f}{g})(x) = \frac{F}{G}; \iff G \neq 0$
- Suppose $f$ is a scalar-valued multivariable function and $g$ is a function of one variable such that the composistion $g \circ f$ is defined on $D$.
  - $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} (g \circ f)(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(f(x))$
- Sandwich principle: if $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = F$ and $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x) = F$ and $f(x) \leq h(x) \leq g(x)$ then $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} h(x) = F$
