# Differenability for Scalar-Value Multivariable Functions
- Let $f$ be a scalar-valued multivariable function defined on a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing some open ball around the point $a$.
- Then $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if:
  $$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)-h\cdot\nabla f(a)}{||h||}=0
  \tag{1}$$
- If $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then
  - Tangent Hyperplane to $f$ at $a$ exists
  - Best linear approximation of $f$ at $a$ is given by the tangent hyperplane
  - It is continuous at $a$
