# What are orthogonal transformations

- Let $V$ be an inner product space and $T$ be a linear transformation from $V$ to $V$. $T$ is said to be **Orthogonal Transformation** if:
  $$<Tv,Tw> = <v,w> \forall v, w \in V$$
- When $V = \mathbb{R}^n$ with the usual inner product, a linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is orthogonal if and only if **Preserves angles and lengths.**
- It is enough to demand that the linear transformation pre-serves lengths.In that case, angles automatically get preserved (think of triangle congruences).

## Finding the rotation matrix in $\mathbb{R}^2$

- Consider the standard basis $\{ (1,0), (0,1)\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Rotate the plane by the angle $\theta$. The vectors obtained after the tell us the matrix corresponding to this linear transformation.
  $$R_\theta = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{bmatrix}$$

### Note

- $R_\theta^T = R_{-\theta}$
- $R_\theta \times R_\theta^T = R_\theta^T \times R_\theta = I$
- Further note that since angles and lengths are preserved and the standard basis is orthonormal, the rotated vectors are also orthonormal and therefore yield an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

## Finding the rotation matrix in $\mathbb{R}^3$

- Consider the rotations about the axes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Since these clearly preserve angles and distances and are linear transformations, they are orthogonal transformations.

- Rotations about the axes can be described by considering its effect on the standard basis $\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}.$

- When considering the rotation about the $Z-axis$, $e_3$ remains unchanged and the $X Y-\text{plane}$ gets rotated exactly as in the previous case of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore its matrix is
  $$T_3{\theta} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
- If we fix the $X-axis$ and rotate the $Y Z-\text{plane}$, we get
  $$T_2{\theta} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ 0 & \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{bmatrix}$$
- If we fix the $Y-axis$ and rotate the $X Z-\text{plane}$, we get
  $$T_1{\theta} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & 0 & \sin \theta \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -\sin \theta & 0 & \cos \theta \end{bmatrix}$$

### Note

- $T_i{\theta}^T = T_i{-\theta}$
- $T_i({\theta}) \times T_i({\theta})^T = T_i({\theta})^T \times T_i({\theta}) = I$

#### Example

- A linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$, where
  - $T(x_1,x_2,x_3) = \frac{1}{3}(x_1 - 2x_2 + 2x_3, 2x_1 - x_2 - 2x_3, 2x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3)$
- Then evaluating $T$ on the standard basis $\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}$, we get
  $$T(e_1) = \frac{1}{3}(1, 2, 2)$$
  $$T(e_2) = \frac{1}{3}(-2, -1, 2)$$
  $$T(e_3) = \frac{1}{3}(2, -2, 1)$$
- Therefore, the matrix corresponding to $T$ is
  $$T = \frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2 \\ 2 & -1 & 2 \\ 2 & -2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
  $$T^T = A^T = \frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 \\ -2 & -1 & -2 \\ 2 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
- As $\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ is an othonormal basis set, the linear transformation $T$ is **Orthogonal Transformation**.
  - Because $A^T A = I_3$




Yes, now that you have found the projections of the point $(3,4,5)$ onto the basis vectors $\mathbf{u}_1=(1,0,-1)$ and $\mathbf{u}_2=(0,1,-1)$, you can use them to find the closest point on the plane to the original point.

To do this, you can use the fact that the closest point on the plane to a given point is the projection of that point onto the plane. Since the plane is defined by the equation $x+y+z=0$, we can write its normal vector as $\mathbf{n}=(1,1,1)$.

Then, the projection of the point $(3,4,5)$ onto the plane is given by:

$$\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{n}}\begin{pmatrix}3\4\5\end{pmatrix}=\left(\frac{\begin{pmatrix}3\4\5\end{pmatrix}\cdot\mathbf{n}}{|\mathbf{n}|^2}\right)\mathbf{n}=\left(\frac{3+4+5}{3}\right)\begin{pmatrix}1\1\1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}4\4\4\end{pmatrix}$$

So the closest point on the plane to the original point $(3,4,5)$ is $(4,4,4)$.

To find the closest distance between the point $(3,4,5)$ and the plane, you can calculate the distance between the original point and the closest point on the plane using the distance formula:

$$d=|\begin{pmatrix}3\4\5\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}4\4\4\end{pmatrix}|=\sqrt{(3-4)^2+(4-4)^2+(5-4)^2}=\sqrt{3}$$

So the closest distance between the point $(3,4,5)$ and the plane $x+y+z=0$ is $\sqrt{3}$.
