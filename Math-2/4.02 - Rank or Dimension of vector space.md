# Dimension / Rank of a vector space

- The dimension of a vector space $V$ is the cardinality of a basis for $V$.
- If $B$ is a basis for $V$, then rank of $V$ is the cardinality of $B$.
- For every vector space there exists a basis,and all bases of a vector space have the same number of elements (or cardinality); hence, the dimension (or rank) of a vector space (say $V$) is uniquely defined and denoted by $dim(V)$ / $rank(V)$ respectively.
