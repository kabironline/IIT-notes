# Direction of Ascent and Descent

- Let $f(x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n)$ be a function defined on a domain in $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing some open ball around the point $a$.
- Suppose $\nabla f$ exists and is continuous on some open ball around the point $a$.
- $f_u = \nabla f \cdot u$ is the directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of $u$.
- $f_u(a) = ||\nabla f(a)|| ||u||\cos \theta$
- It is minimized when $\theta = \pi$ and maximized when $\theta = 0$.
- It is maximised when $u$ is in the same direction as $\nabla f(a)$ or $u = \frac{\nabla f(a)}{||\nabla f(a)||}$.
- It is minimized when $u$ is in the opposite direction as $\nabla f(a)$ or $u = -\frac{\nabla f(a)}{||\nabla f(a)||}$.
- It remains unchanged when $f_u = 0$ or $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$. It is orthogonal or perpendicular to $\nabla f(a)$.

## Example

- $f(x,y) = \sin(xy)$

  - $\nabla f(a) = (y\cos(xy),x\cos(xy))$
  - At $(\pi,1)$
  - $\nabla f(\pi,1) = (1 \cos(\pi), \pi \cos(\pi)) = (-1,\pi)$
  - $u = \frac{\nabla f(\pi,1)}{||\nabla f(\pi,1)||} = \frac{-1,\pi}{\sqrt{1^2 + \pi^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + 1}} \cdot (1,\pi)$

- $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 +z^2$
  - $\nabla f(a) = (2x,2y,2z)$
  - At $(1,1,1) what is the direction in which the function increases fastest?
  - $\nabla f(1,1,1) = (2,2,2)$
  - $u = \frac{(2,2,2)}{\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}(2,2,2)$
