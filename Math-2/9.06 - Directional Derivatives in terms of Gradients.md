# The Gradient vector / function

- Let $f(x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n)$ be a function defined on a domain in $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing some open ball around the point $a$.
- Suppose all the partial derivatives of $f$ exist at $a$. Then the gradient vector of $f$ at $a$ is the vector $(f_{x_1}(a),f_{x_2}(a),\dots,f_{x_n}(a))$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. It is denoted by $\nabla f(a)$.
- The gradient function of $f$ is a function taking values in $\mathbb{R}^n$ obtained by associating to every point $a$ its gradient vector $\nabla f(a)$.
- The domain of $\nabla f$is the set of points in $D$ all of whose partial derivatives exist.

#### Examples

- Let $f(x,y) = \sin(xy)$
  - Then $\nabla f(a) = (y\cos(xy),x\cos(xy))$
- Let $f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+z^2$
  - Then $\nabla f(a) = (2x,2y,2z)$

## Properties of the Gradient

- **Linearity**

  - $$\nabla (cf+g)(x) = c\nabla f(x) + \nabla g(x)$$

- **Chain Rule**

  - $$\nabla (fg)(x) = f(x)\nabla g(x) + g(x)\nabla f(x)$$

- **Quotient Rule**
  - $$\nabla \frac{f}{g}(x) = \frac{g(x)\nabla f(x) - f(x)\nabla g(x)}{g^2(x)}$$

### Note
- Suppose $\nabla f$ exists and is continuous on some open vall around the point $a$. Then for every unit vector $u$, the directional derivative $f_u(a)$ exists and equals $\nabla f(a) \cdot u$.er
