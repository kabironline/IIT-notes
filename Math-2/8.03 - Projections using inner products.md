# The projection of a vector a subspace

# Shortest Distance in $\mathbb{R}^2$

- $A$ and $B$ are points in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ and we want to find the nearest point from $B$ on the line passing through $A$ and the origin. Drop a perpendicular from $B$ on to the line.
  Let $a$ and $b$ be the vectors corresponding to the points A and B respectively.

### Defination

- Let $V$ be an inner product space, $v \in V$ and $W \subseteq V$ be a subspace of $V$. Then the projection of $v$ onto $W$ is in the vector in $proj_W(v),$ computed as follows:
  $$proj_W(v) = \sum_{i=1}^n<v,v_i>v_i$$
- Fact : The definition is independent of the chosen orthonormal basis (i.e. the expression on the RHS does not change even if you choose a different orthonormal basis).
- The projection of $v$ onto $W$ is the vector in $W$ closest to $v$. Note that "closest" is in terms of the distance based on the norm
  induced by the inner product.

#### Example

- $V = \mathbb{R}^2, W = <(3,1)>,v = (1,3)$
  - $\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}(1,3)$
  - $proj_W(v) = <v,\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}(1,3)> \times\sqrt{10}(1,3) = <(1,3),(3,1)>\frac{1}{10}(3,1) = \frac{3+3}{10}(3,1) = \frac{6}{10}(3,1)$

### Projection on a vector and orthogonal bases

- Let $V$ be an inner product space and $v, w \in V$ is defined as follows:
  $$proj_w(v) = proj_{<w>}(v)$$
  $$ proj*w(v) = <v, \frac{w}{||w||}> \frac{w}{||w||} = \frac{<v,w>}{||w||^2}w = \frac{<v,w>}{<w,w>}w$$
  $$proj_W(v) = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{<v,v_i>}{<v_i,v_i>}v_i$$

#### Example

- Let $W$ be the 2-dimensional subpsace of $V = \mathbb{R}^3$ spanned by the orthogonal vectors $v_1 = (1,2,1)$ and $v_2 = (1, â€”1, 1)$. What is the projection of $v = (-2,2,2)$ on $W$.
  - $proj_{v1}v = \frac{<v,v_1>}{v_1,v_1}v_1 = \frac{4}{6} (1,2,1) = \frac{2}{3}(1,2,1)$
  - $proj_{v2}v = \frac{<v,v_2>}{v_2,v_2}v_2 = -\frac{2}{3} (1,-1,1)$
  - $proj_Wv = proj_{v1}v + proj_{v2}v = \frac{2}{3}(1,2,1) - \frac{2}{3} (1,-1,1) = (0,1,0)$

### Projection as a linear transformation

- Let $V$ be an inner product space and $W$ be a subspace of $V$. Then the projection of $v$ onto $W$ is the unique vector in $W$ that is closest to $v$ in the sense of the norm induced by the inner product.
- $P_w(v)$ is the linear transformation that maps $v$ to the projection of $v$ onto $W$.
  $$P_w(v) = proj_W(v)$$
  $$P_W(v_1 + v_2) = P_W(v_1) + P_W(v_2) \ \And \ P_W(cv) = cP(v)$$
- It follows all the properties of a linear transformation.

#### Properties

- $P_W(v) =v, \forall v \in W$
- $Image(P_W) = W$
- $W^{\perp} = \{ v| v \in V,$ such that $<v,w> = 0 \ \forall w \in W\}$ is the null space of $P_W$
- $P_W^2 = P_W$
- $||P_W(v)|| \leq ||v||$
