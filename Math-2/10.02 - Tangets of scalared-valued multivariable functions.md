# Tangents for $f(x,y)$

- Let $f(x,y)$ be a function defined on a domain in $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ containing some open ball around the point $a$.
- Consider a line $L$ in $D$ passing through $a$ and restrict $f$ to $L$.
- Sicne it now a function of one variable, we can consider the tanget to $f$ at $a$ over $L$.
- If the line $L$ is in the direction of the unit vector $u$, then the tangent (if it exists) is given by $f_u(a)$ passing through the point $(a,f(a))$.

## Equations of the tangent line

- $u = (u_1,u_2)$ is a unit vector in the direction of the tangent line.
- $a = (a,b)$ is the point on the tangent line.
- $f_u(a)$ is the directional derivative at $a$ in the direction of $u$.
- $L : z = 0, u_1(y-b) = u_2(x-a)$
- $P : u_1(y-b) = u_2(x-a)$
- $x(t) = a + tu_1$
- $y(t) = b + tu_2$
- $z(t) = 0$
- $(x(t),y(t),z(t)) = (a + tu_1, b + tu_2, 0)$
- Parametric equation of the tangent line is $P(t) = (a + tu_1, b + tu_2, f(a,b) + tf_u(a,b))$

### Example

- $f(x,y) = x + y;$ tangent at $(1,1)$ in the direction of $(1,0)$
  - $f_u(a) = \nabla f \cdot u = 1$
  - $(x(t),y(t),z(t)) = (1 + t, 1, 1 + tf_u(1,1)) = (1 + t, 1, 2 + t)$
- $f(x,y) = xy;$ tangent at $(1,1)$ in the direction of $(3,4)$
  - $u = (\frac{3}{5},\frac{4}{5})$
  - $f_u(1,1) = 1 \cdot \frac{3}{5} + 1 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{7}{5}$
  - $(x(t),y(t),z(t)) = (1 + \frac{3}{5}t, 1 + \frac{4}{5}t, 1 + \frac{7}{5}t)$

# Tangents for scalared-valued multivariable functions

- Let $f(x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n)$ be a function defined on a domain in $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing some open ball around the point $a$.
- Consider a line $L$ in $D$ passing through $a$ and restrict $f$ to $L$.
- Computing this is same as computing it for $R^2$.
