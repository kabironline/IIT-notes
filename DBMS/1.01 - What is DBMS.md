# DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
### DBMS contains information about a perticular enterprise
- Collection of interrelated data
- Set of programs to access the data
- An environment that is both convenient and efficient to use
### Database Applications
- Banking: all transactions
- Airlines: reservations, schedules
- Universities: registration, grades
- Sales: customers, products, purchases
- Manufacturing: production, inventory, orders, supply chain
- Human resources: employee records, salaries, tax deductions
- Databases touch all aspects of our lives
### Databases can vary in size
- From a few megabytes to hundreds of gigabytes or terabytes
### Drawbacks of using file systems to store data
- Data redundancy and inconsistency
  - Multiple file formats, duplication of information in different files
- Difficulty in accessing data
  - Need to write a new program to carry out each new task
- Data isolation
  - Multiple files and formats
- Integrity problems
  - Integrity constraints (e.g. account balance > 0) become part of program code
  - Hard to add new constraints or change existing ones
- Atomicity of updates
  - Failures may leave database in an inconsistent state with partial updates carried out
  - E.g. transfer of funds from one account to another should either complete or not happen at all
- Concurrent access by multiple users
  - Concurrent access needed for performance
  - Uncontrolled concurrent accesses can lead to inconsistencies
    - E.g. two people reading a balance and updating it at the same time
- Security problems
  - Hard to provide user access to some, but not all, data
