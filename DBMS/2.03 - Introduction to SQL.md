# SQL (Structured Query Language)

### What is SQL?

- SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. It is used to query, insert, update and modify data. It is used to create and modify the structure of databases. It is used to create and modify the structure of tables.
- It was developed at IBM in the 1970s. It has been an ANSI/ISO standard since 1986. It has been an ISO/IEC standard since 1987. There are many different versions of the SQL language, but to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

### Datatypes in SQL

<!-- Write most used datatypes and a short desc -->

- Integer : `INT` or `INTEGER`
- Float : `FLOAT` or `REAL` or `DOUBLE` or `DOUBLE PRECISION`
- String : `CHAR(n)` or `VARCHAR(n)` or `TEXT`
  - `CHAR(n)` : Fixed length string of length `n`
  - `VARCHAR(n)` : Variable length string of length `n`
  - `TEXT` : Variable length string of length `n`
- Date : `DATE` or `DATETIME`
- Time : `TIME` or `TIMESTAMP`
- Boolean : `BOOLEAN` or `BOOL`
- Binary : `BINARY(n)` or `VARBINARY(n)` or `BLOB`
- Enum : `ENUM('value1', 'value2', 'value3')`
- and many more

### Creating a Database

- Syntax : `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
- Example : `CREATE DATABASE Student;` - This creates a database named Student.
- Example : `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Student;` - This creates a database named Student if it doesn't exist.

### Creating tables

- Syntax : `CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name1 datatype, column_name2 datatype, column_name3 datatype, ...);`
- Example
  - ````CREATE TABLE Student (Roll_Number INT,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Date_Of_Birth DATE,
    Passport_Number VARCHAR(255),
    Aadhar_Number VARCHAR(255),
    Department VARCHAR(255));
    ```
    ````

### Updating a table

- Insert (DML command)
  - `insert into student values (21CS10001, 'Aman', '2001-01-01', '123456789', '123456789', 'CSE');`
- Delete (DML command)
  - `delete from student where roll_number = 21CS10001;`
- Drop table (DDL command)
  - `drop table student;`
- Alter table (DDL command)
  - `alter table student add column passport_number varchar(255);`
  - `alter table student drop column passport_number;`
  - `alter table student modify column name varchar(255);`
  - `alter table student change column name full_name varchar(255);`
  - `alter table student rename to students;`

### Querying a table

- SQL allows duplicates in relation as well as in result.
- To remove duplicates from result use `distinct` keyword.
- Syntax : `select column_name1, column_name2, ... from table_name where condition1 and condition2 and ...;`
- Example : `select * from student where roll_number = 21CS10001;`
- Example : `select * from distinct student where department = 'CSE';`
- `*` means all columns.
- `where` clause specifies the conditions that must be satisfied by the rows in the result. it returns only those rows that satisfy the condition. we can use logical operators like `and`, `or`, `not` in the `where` clause.
  - Example : `select * from employee where salary > 100000 and department = 'CSE';`
- `select` clause can contain expressions involving `+, - , *` and `/`.
  - `select` clause can contain functions like `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`.
- `from` clause specifies the tables from which the data is to be retrieved. it can contain multiple tables. If we specify multiple tables in the `from` clause then we will get the **cartesian product of the tables.**
  - Example : `select * from student, employee;`

### Set Operations

- Union - Returns a relation with tuples that are in r or s.
  - Syntax : `select * from r union select * from s;`
  - Example : `select * from student union select * from employee;`
  - Example : Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 or in Spring 2010.
    - `select * from course where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2009 union select * from course where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2010;`
- Intersection - Returns a relation with tuples that are in r and s.
  - Syntax : `select * from r intersect select * from s;`
  - Example : `select * from student intersect select * from employee;`
  - Example : Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 and in Spring 2010.
    - `select * from course where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2009 intersect select * from course where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2010;`
- Difference - Returns a relation with tuples that are in r but not in s. It returns a relation with tuples that are in r but not in s.
  - Syntax : `select * from r except select * from s;`
  - Example : `select * from student except select * from employee;`
  - Example : Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 but not in Spring 2010.
    - `select * from course where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2009 except select * from course where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2010;`
- Example : Find the salary of all instructors that are less than the highest salary of all instructors.
  - ```sql
    select distinct T.salary
    from instructor as T
    where T.salary < S.salary
    ```
- To retain duplicates use `union all`, `intersect all`, `except all`.
- Suppose a tuple occurs $m$ times in $r$ and $n$ times in $s$ then it occurs
  - $m + n$ times in $r$ `union all` $s$
  - min($m, n$) times in $r$ `intersect all` $s$
  - max($m - n, 0$) times in $r$ `except all` $s$

### Null Values

- Null values are values that are unknown, missing, or not applicable. Null values can be used to represent missing data. Null values can be used to represent unknown data. Null values can be used to represent not applicable data.
- Null values are not equal to any other value. Null values are not equal to any other null value. Null values are not equal to any other value including null values.
- If any column is nullable then it can contain null values. Then we need to use `is null` or `is not null` to check if the value is null or not.
- We cannot perform any operation on null values. If we try to perform any operation on null values then the result will be null.
- Example : Find the names of all students who have no advisor.
  - ```sql
    select S.name
    from student as S
    where S.advisor is null
    ```

### Three valued logic

- Three valued logic is a logic that has three truth values: true, false, and unknown.
- Three Valued using the value unknown
  - `true and unknown = unknown`
  - `false and unknown = false`
  - `true or unknown = true`
  - `false or unknown = unknown`
  - `not unknown = unknown`
- Result of `where` clause predicate is treated as false if the predicate evaluates to `false` or `unknown`.

### Aggregate Function

- These functions operate on a set of values and return a single value.
- `sum` : returns the sum of all values in the set.
- `avg` : returns the average of all values in the set.
- `min` : returns the minimum of all values in the set.
- `max` : returns the maximum of all values in the set.
- `count` : returns the number of values in the set.
- Example : Find the average salary of all instructors grouped by department.
  - ```sql
    select avg(T.salary) as avg_salary
    from instructor as T
    group by T.dept_name
    ```
- `group by` clause is used to group the tuples in the relation based on the value of an attribute. It returns a relation with one tuple for each group.
- Example : Find the names and average salaries of all departments whose average salary is greater than 42000.
  - ```sql
    select T.dept_name, avg(T.salary) as avg_salary
    from instructor as T
    group by T.dept_name
    having avg(T.salary) > 42000
    ```
- The `count(*)` function counts the number of tuples in the relation.
  -  it will ignore null values. It will not count null values.
