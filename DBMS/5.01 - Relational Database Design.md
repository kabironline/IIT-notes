# What is a good database design?
- Reflects real-world structure of the problem
- Can represent all expected data over time
- Avoids redundant storage of data items
- Provides efficient access to data
- Supports the maintenance of data integrity over time
- Clean, consistent, and easy to understand
- Note: These objectives are sometimes contradictory!
# A good schema is:
- A good schema is one that is well designed to meet the needs of the application and the database system
- A good schema is one that is well designed to meet the needs of the application and the database system
- It doesnt have any unnecessary redundancy
- It follows the normalization rules
## Redundancy
- having multiple copies of same data in the database.
  - This problem arises when a database is not normalized
  - It leads to anomalies
- What causes redundancy?
  - Poor database design
  - Lack of normalization
  - Lack of coordination among designers
  - Lack of communication among designers
  - Lack of communication among users
## Anomalies
### Insertion Anomaly
- When the insertion of a data record is not possible without adding some additional unrelated data to the record
- We cannot add an Instructor in instructor-with-department if the department does not have a buildin or bud et
### Deletion Anomaly
- When the deletion of a data record results in the loss of some unrelated data items
- If we delete the last instructor in instructor-with-department, we lose information about the department budget
### Update Anomaly
- When the modification of a data record results in the inconsistency of data items in the record or in other records in the database.
- If we change the department budget in instructor-with-department, we have to change all the tuples for that department in the relation to maintain consistency of data in the database.
## Decomposition
- Decomposition is the process of splitting a relation into two or more relations that contain fewer attributes than the original relation and yet are still able to represent the same information.
- Is every decomposition good?
  - No, some decompositions are bad it needs to preserve the information and avoid anomalies when putting the decomposed relations back together again.
  - If we cannot put back the information together again, then the decomposition is bad. It is called a _**lossy decomposition**_.
  - Lossless Join Decomposition is a decomposition of a relation R into relations $R_1$, $R_2$ such that if we perform natural join of two smaller relations it will return the original relation
- We can normalize the database to get a good decomposition that is free of anomalies.
## Normalization
- Normalization is the process of decomposing relations with anomalies to produce smaller, well-structured relations.
### First Normal Form (1NF)
- A relation is in 1NF if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
- A domain is atomic if its elements are considered to be indivisible units
  - Examples of non-atomic domains:
    - Set of names, composite attributes
    - Identification numbers like CSIOI that can be broken up into parts
- A relational schema R is in First Normal Form (INF) if
  - the domains of all attributes of R are atomic
  - the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain
- A relation that is not in 1NF is said to have a repeating group and non-atomic domains
- Rows must not have multiple values in the same column
### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
- A relation schema $R$ is in BCNF with respect to the set $F$ of functional dependencies if for all functional dependencies in $F^+$ of the form $X \rightarrow A$, at least one of the following holds:
  - $X \rightarrow A$ is a trivial functional dependency (i.e. $A \in X$)
  - $X$ is a superkey for schema $R$
#### Atomicity
- A domain is atomic if its elements are considered to be indivisible units
  - Examples of non-atomic domains:
    - Set of names, composite attributes
    - Identification numbers like CSIOI that can be broken up into parts
  - If in a schema $R$ and a non-trivial dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ causes a violation of BCNF,we decompose into R
    - $\alpha \cup \beta$
    - $(R -  (\alpha \cup \beta))$
  - Lossless-join decomposition
    - If we decompose relation $R$ into $R_1$ and $R_2$
    - $R_1 
## Functional Dependencies
- A functional dependency is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation from a database. In other words, functional dependency is a constraint that describes the relationship between attributes in a relation.
- A functional dependency is denoted by an arrow $X \rightarrow Y$, where $X$ is the determinant and $Y$ is the dependent attribute.
- $X$ is a Superkey for a reational schema $R$ if and only if $X \rightarrow R$ is a functional dependency for $R$.
- $X$ is a Candidate Key for a relational schema $R$ if and only if $X$ is a superkey for $R$ and no proper subset of $X$ is a superkey for $R$.
- We use functional dependencies to:
  - test relations to see if they are legal under a given set of functional dependencies.
    - If a relation r is legal under a set F of functional dependencies, we say that satisfies F
  - specify constraints on the set of legal relations
- We say that F holds on R if all legal relations on R satisfy the set of functional dependencies F
- Note: A specific instance of a relation schema may satisfy a functional dependency even if the functional dependency does not hold on all legal instances
- Given a set of Functional Dependencies F, we can infer new dependencies by the following rules:
  - Reflexivity: If $Y \subseteq X$, then $X \rightarrow Y$
  - Augmentation: If $X \rightarrow Y$, then $XZ \rightarrow YZ$
  - Transitivity: If $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow Z$, then $X \rightarrow Z$
  - Union: If $X \rightarrow Y$ and $X \rightarrow Z$, then $X \rightarrow YZ$
  - Decomposition: If $X \rightarrow YZ$, then $X \rightarrow Y$ and $X \rightarrow Z$
  - Pseudotransitivity: If $X \rightarrow Y$ and $WY \rightarrow Z$, then $WX \rightarrow Z$
- These axioms can be repeadtedly applied to generate new FDs and dadded to F
- A new FD obtained by applying the axims is said to the **Logically implied ** by F
- The process of generations of FSs terminate after a finite number of steps and the resulting set of FDs is called the **Closure** of $F^+$.
  - $F^+ \subseteq F$
- These axioms are:
  - Sound (generate only valid FDs)
  - Complete (generate all valid FDs)
### Closure of a set of Functional Dependencies
- Given a set of attributes $\alpha$ and a set of functional dependencies $F$, the closure of $\alpha$ under $F$, denoted $F^+(\alpha)$, is the set of all attributes that are functionally determined by $\alpha$.
#### Uses of Closure
- There are several uses of attribute closure algorithm
  - Testing for superkeys
  - Testing functional dependencies
