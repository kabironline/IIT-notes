# Relational Operators
## Selection Operator
- Notation : σ<sub>P</sub>(R)
- $p$ is called the selection predicate and $R$ is the relation
- σ<sub>P</sub>(R) = $\{t | t ∈ R \text{and} P(t) \text{is true} \}$

## Projection Operator
- Notation : π<sub>L</sub>(R)
- $L$ is a list of attributes
- π<sub>L</sub>(R) = $\{t[L] | t ∈ R \}$
- π<sub>L</sub>(R) = $\{t_1[L], t_2[L], t_3[L], \dots, t_n[L] \}$

## Union Operator
- Notation : $R ∪ S$
- R ∪ S = $\{t | t ∈ R \text{ or } t ∈ S \}$
- R ∪ S = $\{t_1, t_2, t_3, \dots, t_n \}$

## Set Difference Operator
- Notation : $R - S$
- R - S = $\{t | t ∈ R \text{ and } t ∉ S \}$
- R - S = $\{t_1, t_2, t_3, \dots, t_n \}$
- R - S = R - (R ∩ S)

## Intersection Operator
- Notation : $R ∩ S$
- R ∩ S = $\{t | t ∈ R \text{ and } t ∈ S \}$

## Cartesian Product Operator
- Notation : $R × S$
- R × S = $\{t_1, t_2, t_3, \dots, t_n \}$
- Assume that the attributes of R and S are disjoint, if not, rename them to make them disjoint.

## Rename Operator
- Allows us to name, and therefore to refer to, the results of relational-algebra expressions.
- Allows us to refer to a relation by more than one name.
- Example:
  - $\rho_{x}(E)$
  - returns the same relation as $E$, but the result relation is named $x$.

## Division Operator
- Notation : $R ÷ S$
- R ÷ S = $\{t | t ∈ R \text{ and } t[S] ∈ S \}$
- The result of the division operator is a relation that contains all tuples t such that t[R] is in R and t[S] is in S.
- The division operator is not a primitive operator in the relational algebra.
- The division operation is applied to two relations
$R(Z) \div S(X)$, where $X$ subset $Z$. Let $Y = Z - X$ (and hence $Z = X ∪ Y)$; that is, let Y be the set of that are not
- The result of DIVISION is a relation T (Y) that includes a tuple t if and only if there is no tuple in $S(X)$ for which $t[X]$ is not equal to $s[X]$ for all s in $S(X)$.

# Predicate Logic
- Predicate Logic or Predicate Calculus is an extension of Propositional Logic Boolean Algebra.
- It adds the concept of predicates and quantifiers to better capture the meaning ofstatements that cannot be adequately expressed by propositional logic.
- Tuple Relational Calculus and Domain Relational Calculus are based on Predicate Calculus
- Predicate Calculus is also known as First Order Logic
## Predicate
- A predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables. It is usually denoted by a letter such as P, Q, and so on. The values of the variables are not known.
- Example: P(x) = “x is a student in this class” is a predicate. The truth value of P(x) depends on the value of x. If x is the name of a student in this class, then P(x) is true; otherwise, P(x) is false.
### Proposition vs Predicate
- A proposition is a statement that is either true or false, but not both. A predicate is a statement that depends on one or more variables. The truth value of a predicate depends on the values of its variables.
- Example: “x is a student in this class” is a predicate. “x is a student in this class” is true if x is the name of a student in this class; otherwise, it is false. “x is a student in this class” is a proposition if x is a specific student in this class.
## Quantifiers
- Quantifiers are used to express the quantity of predicates. There are two types of quantifiers: universal quantifier and existential quantifier.
- There are two types of quantifiers:
  - Universal Quantifier
  - Existential Quantifier
### Universal Quantifier
- The universal quantifier is used to express that a predicate is true for all values of a variable. It is denoted by $\forall$ (read as “for all”). The universal quantifier is also called the universal quantification.
- Example: $\forall x P(x)$ is read as “for all x, P(x) is true.” It means that P(x) is true for all values of x. $\forall x P(x)$ is true if and only if P(x) is true for all values of x. $\forall x P(x)$ is false if and only if P(x) is false for at least one value of x.
- Example: $\forall x (x^2 > 0)$ is true because $x^2 > 0$ is true for all values of x.
  - Universal quantifier are true if and only if the predicate is true for all values of the variable in the universe of discourse.

### Existential Quantifier
- The existential quantifier is used to express that a predicate is true for at least one value of a variable. It is denoted by $\exists$ (read as “there exists”). The existential quantifier is also called the existential quantification.
- Example: $\exists x P(x)$ is read as “there exists x such that P(x) is true.” It means that P(x) is true for at least one value of x. $\exists x P(x)$ is true if and only if P(x) is true for at least one value of x. $\exists x P(x)$ is false if and only if P(x) is false for all values of x.

## Safety of Expressions
- It is possible to write expressions in the tuple relational calculus that are not safe. They can generate infinite relations. For example, the expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation. The expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation. The expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation. The expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation. The expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation. The expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation. The expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation. The expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation. The expression $\{t | ∃s (R(s) ∧ t[A] = s[A]) \}$ is not safe because it generates an infinite relation and so on and so forth...
